This is not the case. The face on Mars is a naturally occuring land form called a mesa. It was not created by aliens, and there is no consiracy to hide alien lifeforms on mars. There is no evidence that NASA has found that even suggests that this face was created by aliens.\\n\\nA mesa is a naturally occuring rock formation, that is found on Mars and Earth. This \"face\" on mars only looks like a face because humans tend to see faces wherever we look, humans are obviously extremely social, which is why our brain is designed to recognize faces.\\n\\nMany conspiracy theorists believe that NASA is hiding life on Mars from the rest of the world. These people would be very wrong. If NASA found life on Mars, then they would get millions of people\\'s attention. NASA\\'s budget would increase drasticly, which means that their workers would get paid more. There is no good reason that NASA would hide life on Mars from the rest of the world.\\n\\nSo, NASA is not hiding life on Mars from us, and they are not trying to trick us into thinking that the \"face\" on mars is just a mesa, because it actually is. NASA hiding life would be illogical, because if they found life on Mars, they would make a lot of money, and we all know that the people at NASA aren\\'t illogical people.',\n"," \"Driverless cars are exaclty what you would expect them to be. Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet. The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur.\\n\\nOne thing that the article mentions is that the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so.\\n\\nAnother thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion. Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery.\\n\\nOne last thing that the article mentions is negative about the developement of driverless cars is who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect. Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with.\\n\\nWith all these things that could possibly go wrong with these driverless cars there is no way that the developement of them should continue any further. In today's society if something bad COULD happen or something COULD go wrong, it WILL happen, and it WILL go wrong. There are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars. Becuase of all of these problems that arise with the cars it is just a gargantuan risk to implement these cars into our lifestyles. \",\n"," 'Dear: Principal\\n\\nI am arguing against the policy change because even though there are some children out there that really needs help with their academic work, that does not mean that only because they have a c average that would not let them enjoy their sports or other activities unless they\\'ve a B average.\\n\\nSometimes teachers or even principal needs to consider that we should give the help that any student should have. Also this may consider student self as steam. Meaning student would start to feel sad nervous, and not wanting to go to school because of the reason they have a low averages and they can not participate in other activities or sports. The fact that there are children that would want to enjoy many good things the school is actually giving it to them.\\n\\nWe would want to make changes as, \"like to be a better person for a better tomorrow\" This supports the idea of having have many good thoughts and incasing your work as much as possible. In some situation like arguing we should make a vote to see if kids would want to have a school policy of change and having to participate in fun activities but they first need to have at least a B average. Some reasons I would be against the school policy change is because you would feel ashame and then many bad things could happen meaning, you would be angry etc. In additionally , I think that student should have sports because it helps them with their health, and problems that they would have personal. I am against this policy change.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nStudent.',\n"," 'Would you be able to give your car up? Having to ride with strangers on the bus to reduce pollution. Would you be able to pay the fines after driving your car?\\n\\nMost people nowadays wouldn\\'t give up their car to save their life. We\\'ve been so used to having cars since they came out we\\'ve just forgotten what It\\'s like using our bikes, or walking from point A to point B. \"70 percent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move here\" Says passage number 1 paragraph 3. Imagine selling your car just to live somewhere else. Not having a car would for one, reduce the amount of pollution in the area, but two, also reduce the amount of stress. Come to think of it, it would also lessen the number of deaths. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Said Heidrun Walter. She uses her bike to get from place to place. Which could e a lot more healthy. We most likely wouldn\\'t have so many obese people.\\n\\nA lot of people have bad health just because of where they live. All these cars polluting the area does not help the fact that most people with asthma, It\\'s just slowly killing them because their lungs can\\'t get enough air as it is. \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog... the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" The gas that makes these cars zoom around the world is hurting the enviroment. Polluting our streets, making it so foggy out that drivers can hardly see. Not only does diesel fuel hurt our ecosystem, it hurts our wallets too. How much does the average person spend on gas in their lifetime? A lot, don\\'t you think? You probably have to fill up your tank every week or so, depending how far you drive. Just think of all the other items you could buy instead of having to pay for gas. Shoot, we\\'d probably all be millionares if we set aside our gas money.\\n\\nDeath. Death is a major problem. Due to alcohol and stupidity plus cars equal not very good outcome. Most people aren\\'t even safe when the drive so it\\'s not like cars can drive themselves and not get in an accident. Police were starting to fine people if their license plate was even or odd, depending on the day. Would you really want to be fined for driving a car? Save the time and effort on your precious little car and ride your bike to the grocery store. Or instead of driving your dog to the dog park, walk him or her there. Maybe instead of running an aron in the car why don\\'t you actually RUN the aron.\\n\\nCars cause a lot of problems in most of our cities, countries, states, islands, whever. It would be ten times easier just to tone it down a notch.    ',\n"," \"I think that students would benefit from learning at home,because they wont have\\xa0to change and get up early in the morning to shower and do there hair. taking only classes helps them because at there house they'll be pay more attention. they will be comfortable at home.\\n\\nThe hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then you'll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear.\\n\\nmost students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go.\\n\\nwhen your home your\\xa0comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that

Generic_Name kicks the soccer ball as hard as she can towards the goal. The goaly is surprised but quick on her feet as she thrusts herself towards the ball and catches it before it reaches the net. The referee blows the whistle and that is the end of the game. Generic_Name has not only let herself down, but her team as well. Each team shake hands with each other and leave the field. You have an expression on your face that describes disappointment and anger. Our school\\'s principal, Generic_Name then looks at you from the bleachers and calls you over. As you make your way across the field, you keep yourself questioning yourself. What did I do? Am i going to be kicked off the team? Am I not good enough? Generic_Name asks you whether or not you think everybody at school should do at least one activity or sport. Generic_Name disagrees with this statement because students have after school activities they do that include sports, private lessons, and even classes.\\n\\nSports are a great way to exercise and distract yourself from school or even things that are stressful. There are different types of sports including football, soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, etc. Imagine yourself running across the field with a football. The game is about to end and you are tied with the other team 21-21. You are so close to making a touchdown when out of the corner of your eye, you see the other team sprinting toward you. You run faster and sprint across the field and make the touchdown. The score is now 22-21 as the whistle blows the end of the game. Your team picks you up and runs you across the field, yelling and screaming your name, \"Generic_Name! Generic_Name!\". Generic_Name looks your way and smiles as your still questioning. Did I change his mind? Will students be able to make their own choices of what they want?\\n\\nPrivate lessons is another activity that most likely will be after school. There are many lessons people take and most of them are orchestra and band lessons. Orchestra lessons include the violin, viola, cello, and bass. For example, say you play the violin and you signed up for lessons. You feel the light, warm breeze on your arms as you make your way inside. You\\'re then lead to a room where you see all the instruments of the orchestra. The instructor tells you to play a D major scale. As you spend an hour doing scales and playing music, you\\'re time ran out and it is time to go home. You feel the slightest touch against your shoulder and as you turn around. The instructor is holding a music book for you to practice. You then take the book and make your way home.\\n\\nClasses include usually art or wood making. In the wood making classes, you\\'re given a block of wood and instructions that give you a task you must complete. In art classes, the instructor guides you through the process for your assignment and gives you the materials. After she tells you what your doing, you\\'re then allowed to start on your own to accomplish the assignment. The art materials include paint, crayons, colored pencils, shading tools, chalk, paint brushes, etc. The wood making classes include a block of wood, sandpaper, and machines throughout the class to cut off a piece from the block. Generic_Name loves art and does painting herself with a paintbrush and a holder with different colored paints. Generic_Name also has an easel to hold her artwork, a stool to sit, and a basket with all her colored paints.\\n\\nStudents at school should have a choice on whether they want to do an activity or a sport. People can\\'t\\xa0make decisions for others but they can make decisions for themselves. Generic_Name shouldn\\'t have students pick school\\xa0activities\\xa0over after school activities. Students shouldn\\'t have to choose something for school and have to give up something they enjoy after school for that certain activity or sport. Imagine yourself falling into a deep hole and have to decide over two things to get out. One choice you want but it will affect your life while the other choice wouldn\\'t but you would not enjoy it. How would you feel? What would you choose? I disagree with this statement because many students have after school activities that may include sports, private lessons, and classes that they enjoy and are not ready to give up yet.\\xa0', 'Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn\\'t have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name\\'s alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, \"Are you on your way to football practice?\" \"Unfortunately,\" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn\\'t bad at football, he just didn\\'t enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn\\'t because too many people who didn\\'t want to participate signed up. \"How\\'s the student council?\" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. \"I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,\" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn\\'t have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn\\'t enjoy it as much because those who didn\\'t want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn\\'t have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren\\'t interesting to them.\\xa0I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students\\' after school\\xa0activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.\\n\\nThe first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students\\' after school\\xa0activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after school\\xa0activities.\\n\\nAnother reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don\\'t want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they\\'re being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won\\'t be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn\\'t interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren\\'t provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don\\'t wish to participate.\\n\\nIn addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don\\'t want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you\\'re on a team, whether it\\'s a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn\\'t putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who\\'s not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they\\'re interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyable\\xa0if a student doesn\\'t participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.\\n\\nGeneric_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team\\'s effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. \"Guess what?\" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. \"What?\" Generic_Name replied curiously. \"I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!\" \"Congratulations, Generic_Name,\" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, \"See you later, Generic_Name.\" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn\\'t have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team\\'s effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students\\' after school\\xa0activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.']\n","['Electoral College is where we pick our state elector to choose our president. We as citizen get to help choose our state\\'s electors when we vote. It\\'s a benefit to keep our Electoral College in the government system.\\n\\nAfter all, Electoral College do have their negatives. In the source \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid denfenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer claims that \"voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors.\" We are not voting for our own president, but choosing an electors for our own state to go on and help us vote for our United States of America\\'s president,but with an Electoral College every state get two Senators and one House of Representatives. Which divide everything equally. Our votes are counted by our population of people. So, the Electoral College shouldn\\'t be change.\\n\\nMainly, Electoral College help us vote for our president. In the source \"What is the Electoral College\" by the Office of the Federal Register assert that the winner of the president is \"election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" The more popular votes our states is given the higher chance that president is going to be elected. \"Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president\" out of 538 votes for a presidnet to win. With an Electoral College each president have to get at least 270 elector votes from all the 50 states for them to be president.\\n\\nLastly, Electoral College have no run-off elections. In the source \"In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner mentioned that with no run-offs there wouldn\\'t be any \"complicate the presidential election process.\" There will never be a tie votes between an election. For example, between Nixon and Clinton both got 43 percent popular votes which is a tie and hard to pick, but with an elector vote their votes are 301:370 which is a big difference.\\n\\nIn summary, Electoral College is a useful system in the government that should be kept in place. It has been used over the years and it would be a pain to change everything now.    ', \"There is always a constant arguement about keeping the Electoral College or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I personally feel that we should abolish the Electoral College and change the election by popular vote. I don't think it is fair to our voters who vote for the president when they are really voting for the state of electors. The Electoral College really has the final say on who is going to be elected president of the United States. The citizens of the United States should be the one who elect the president instead of the Electoral College.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Electoral college is a little outdated now a days. The Electoral College has been used for a very long time and it should be changed. To me I believe that it just makes sense to have voters to vote for our president instead of the winner-take-all system. It wouldn't even make sense to vote if you know that the Electoral College is going to actually elect the president. Abolishing the Electoral College is just the best way to go.\\n\\nNext, The Electoral College is just unfair to the voters who vote for the president. It is because of the wininer-take-all system. The candidates dont't go to states they know they are going lose in. Instead they go for the swing states so they can a better chance of winning. Some states wouldn't even see the candidates at all. So abolishing the Electoral College is the best way to go.\\n\\nIn conclusion, people are alyways debating on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that we should abolish the Electoral College and let the election go by popular vote. I dont think the Electoral College is fair for voter because they actually elect the president. If we abolish the Electoral College then the people can vote for our president the right way. In the future hopefully this will happen because the Electoral College is just not relavent anymore.       \\xa0       \\xa0    \", 'December 18, 2014\\n\\nDear State Senator,\\n\\nChanging to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is more beneficial to the people than an Electoral College. The Electoral College is such a hassle and a process. It\\'s outdated. And it\\'s even irrational. It\\'s not precise to what the people want. The popular vote directly represents who the people want. \"-over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" (Source 2).\\n\\nThe Electoral College is outdated. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution. Back then that was relevant because there weren\\'t as many people in the United States as there are now, which means there are more voters today. In Source 3 it says that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. It\\'s not even a democratic method in modern sense...\\n\\nThe people trust the elector\\'s to vote for their nominee. And that trust can even be broken, so they\\'re not 100% reliable. \"-state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are....\" (Source 1). There\\'s a chance that your vote might not even count. The Electoral College method may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. So even if that candidate got a lot of votes in one state the Electoral College can still eliminate that candidate regardless of the people\\'s votes. \"Most states have a \\'winner-take-all\\' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" (Source 1). The winner-take-all system is unfair because candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, so they focus only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. Which makes smaller states feel so irrelevant. They know their vote will have no effect because they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign.\\n\\nPlus the Electoral College is such an inconventient thing. It is a process that consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. And a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Why do that when people can just have an overall majority vote on the President? Voters can even expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Voters don\\'t even vote for the president, their votes are for the slate of electors, who then elect the president. There could even be confusion that the voters vote for the wrong candidate because they are confused about the electors.\\n\\nSome people may not like the popular vote for the election of the president because they\\'re afraid of a tie. But in the Electoral College if there was a tie it would lead into a whole new process with the House of Representatives. Most worry about a tie in the electoral votes. The House of Representatives hardly refelects the will of the people.\\n\\nBy changing to the election of popular vote for the president it is way more beneficial to the people because it is a direct way of them having a say in the election. They choose. They don\\'t have to worry about a trust being broken. It\\'s straight forward to the point. The Electoral College is unfair, not 100% trustworthy, and outdated. Take time to think about converting to the popular vote election.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME   ']\n","[\"Dear, Principle\\n\\nI disagree with the new school policy you are trying to change because it isn't fair to the students of your school. It isn't fair that you want to change the sports activity unless these students have a grade B average. Many of the students that are involved in these sports activity have a grade C average. If they don't have a grade B average they are not allowed to participate in these school activities. It would be very hard for them to keep up with a B average for the rest of the year.\\n\\nNot many students would be able to be in these after school activities because of their grade average. You wouldn't have that many students in your sports activity either if they don't have a B average. It's not fair to change the school policy now that you only have a C average.\\n\\nThese students who are in these activities would not be able to be in them anymore. Some students might be very good at some sports and they would not be able to join because of the new school policy you are trying to be approved.\\n\\nIf you do change it, it won't be fair to the other students who try to keep that average and still be able to be in the schools activities. For some students it take a while to learn a new topic and they might be really good at something else. They would not know because they wouldn't be able to try out for that sport. They might even have a C average and they wouldn't be able to be in that sports because they might have not succeeded at having a B average.\\n\\nFor other students they are not just good at sports; some have a talent at other things like art. But they would not be able to at least try to be in an art club because you have change the school policy. Only students that really good at their school work would be able to join these activities that they are good at.\\n\\nOnce again if you do change this new school policy you would be unfair to the students and you would not be giving them a chance by not letting them participate at what they might be best at the most. For some students they might not have been able to keep such a high average for these students.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\", \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI think that students should be able to participate in sports activities with a C average. The reason for that is because most students are C average students. It wouldn't be fair to them because a C isn't a bad grade. It would make them feel bad that they put in hard work and there not able to participate in school sports. It wouldn't be fair and students would get and cause a lot of problems.\\n\\nI honestly think it wouldn't be fair to let students with a B average participate in school activities but not Students with a C average. There is no reason not to let students with a C average participate in school activities. I know getting a C isn't the best grade but its still an okay grade. Also students work hard to get the grade they have and not letting them join sports would make them feel like they don't try hard when they try there hardest.\\n\\nIf kids who are C average weren't able to be on school sports team then there wouldn't be a team because kids who are athletes are more likely to be C students. So there wouldn't really be any kids trying out for a team. That wouldn't be good for our school because it would take away fun for students. It would also take away our school spirit.\\n\\nIn my opinion i think it would be good to let students with C average participate in school activities. The reason for that is because like i said C isn't a bad grade. If students would get a D then that's a whole different story. But a C really isn't that bad. Sometimes the best student in class gets a C too. Also most of the good athletes are C students. It wouldn't be good for our school. It would give our school a bad name because people would think that we don't have that many smart students. That would give our school and teachers and bad name because their the ones teaching us and we wouldn't look all that smart because we would most likely have a C.\\n\\nThese are my reasons why i think students with C average should be able to participate in school sports. It would be better for our school and our students. Sports are the thing students love the most about school and it shouldn't be fair that we would take that from them. That's why i think C average students should participate in school sports.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\", \"Extracurricular activities are important for students, and I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should try something new instead of doing nothing. Students can gain a lot from this experience, so I believe that they should participate in them. I think that even if students don't want to participate in these activities, they should because they can learn things that they never knew before, and I think that it could make an impact on their lives. Extracurricular activities are good for students to participate in because they can give you something to do, they can help you meet and befriend\\xa0new people, and they can help kids find potential ideas and hobbies.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities can give you something to do. Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities are a good way to socialize with people because you are participating in activities and games that you enjoy with other people. You share the same interests, and liking the same things as someone else is a good way to bond and socialize with people. I met a lot of people through after-school volleyball, and I am still friends with most of them to this day. Our team would go out to restaurants after our games whether we won or lost because we were friends, and we liked to play together. We all liked playing the sport, so it was easy to make friends with each other. I also met a lot of people through my art club because we liked to draw, and we liked to talk to each other. If you have trouble making friends, you will most likely be able to socialize and bond with others through these events. I met one of my best friends through after-school dance classes when I was in elementary school. We enjoy dancing and listening to music together. Not only are extracurricular activities able to help you get to know people, but they can also help you find your interests.\\n\\nHaving schools require students to take at least one extracurricular activity can help them find hobbies, and they can help students find things that they didn't know they were interested in. For example, I once convinced my sister to play volleyball. She didn't really want to do it. After school that day, she came to our volleyball practice. She ended up loving the sport, and she also plays it to this day. There are many different activities, such as theater, art, sports, science and math clubs, and the student council. Students are most likely going to find an activity they like and stick with it as they get older. Doing an activity that you enjoy can be very entertaining, and you might keep doing it in the future. I am in my school's eighth grade chorus, and I want to continue this activity as I get into high school. If you really enjoy these activities at school, you might also try to practice them at home. If you like to go to an art club at your school, you might continue to draw at home. These activities can also lead to trying to improve in your hobby as well. I continue to draw at home so I can improve. Schools give access to these potential new hobbies and activities, and I think that students should go to them and give them a chance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. It is something that I believe is crucial to who students grow up to be. If students join an after-school\\xa0activity, they can become more responsible. Having them sit around all day can make that person lazy in the future. They not might want to try new things in the future because they were raised that way. Giving kids these potential interests can help impact their choices in life, such as what they want to do for a job or what they want to do for a hobby. People might already have their future planned, but joining an extracurricular activity can change their views and can give them new ideas. Overall, I think that extracurricular activities are a good way for students and kids to spend their time participating in and enjoying.\\xa0\"]\n","[\"Why do people ask multiple people for\\xa0their opinion? Shouldn't they just trust one opinion? People sometimes ask for multiple opinions to help them with a tough decision. It can be difficult to make choices for yourself sometimes. You can give someone advice, but they would ask other people what they thought too. Seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial to a person making a decision because it gives them more options, multiple points of view, and helps them make the best decision.\\n\\nThe more options the better when it comes to making choices. When people ask for advice from multiple people,\\n\\nthey get more options of what they could do. Having more options is better for the person trying to make to choice. For example, if Generic_Name asks me for my advice on which running event she should do. I might say the two-hundred meter, but Generic_Name might say the one-hundred meter. After we both give her our opinion she has to choose. It it important to get more options before making choices. The more options people have the better choice they can make for them self.\\n\\nWhen people have a decision they need to hear other peoples advice. If the person making the choice doesn't ask other people for advice\\xa0they will follow what they think is right, even if it is wrong. The person making the choice would think it is right because that is their side of it, but if they ask other people they will see more than their side, and might not follow their own advice because they realized it was wrong. The person only realized\\xa0they were wrong when they asked the other person for advice. Also when a person ask other people for advice they see what other people would think of them depending on the choice they make. When people see what other people would think of them sometimes it influence the decision that they make. When they ask for advice it shows them more points of view.\\n\\nWhen people ask multiple people for advice they get more options and more points of view, but it also helps them make the best choice possible. When people ask for advice it shows them that their first choice might not have been the best. it also helps them get more options, so that they can make the wisest choice of what they should do. It can be difficult for\\xa0a person the choose what they think is best for them, but the advice that is given to them really helps them make the best choice. People should always ask for multiple opinions before making a choice because it is\\xa0very beneficial to them as they make the choice. Asking for multiple opinions will help the person make the best choice.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is important for people to ask for advice before making a decision. Asking for multiple opinions is helpful for many reasons. The advice they are given will give them more options of what to do, show them more points of view, and it will help them make the choice that will benefit them the most. When someone asks you for advice try to give them advice that will benefit them the very most. It is important for them to get good advice to make the best possible decision. That is why people ask for multiple opinions as they try to make important decisions.\\xa0\\xa0   \\xa0\\xa0\", \"People in a everyday normal life have a question to ask there not unsure about. So they ask people if they agree with what there saying or if they disagree. I do agree that you should ask more then one person for multiple opinions and for a better response. Also some people only ask one person for an answer which is not the best thing to do because one opinion is not as good as multiple opinions. Talking to more people for more opinions on your question gives you a much more diverse answer.\\n\\nIf someone ask people for advice, they would most likely ask more then one person which is a really good idea. Asking multiple people for advice gives you a much more better response and much more opinions which is really good advice. If you ask one person for advice there going to say either yes or no, which is not horrible but if you ask like 10 different people they are all going to give you there opinions on what they think and then from there you guys can narrow it down to the best possible answer. Also asking multiple people allows you to do better choices for yourself. Overall seeking for multiple opinions is a better choice and would give you better advice.\\n\\nAsking multiple people for advice gives you a better response because you are going to have more then one person asking you what they think you should do. You should always try to search for the best advice you can get because it gives you more ideas. The more and more people you ask the better advice your going to get but you don't want to ask to much people because it could get out of hand. If you ask only one person for advice they could give you good advice that could help you, but it also really depends on the person. But it always so much better to ask multiple people because it helps you out more.\\n\\nYou can also tell the difference between asking one person or multiple people for advice. If you ever wanted really good advice you should ask more then one person. Also seeking multiple opinions could make your life so much easier because it lets you do better choices. Overall you should be asking more then one person because it allows you to do better choices for yourself. Those were all my reasons\\xa0on why I think asking multiple people for advice is a better choice.\", 'Many people ask for advice in their lifetime. When it comes to asking for advice it could lead you to success or even failure. When people ask for advice they could get the right or even the wrong answer. Advice is not just a simple thing most people ask because they are clueless on what to do. It is a good idea to ask multiple people for advice in ways like it gives you more than one way on how to do something, someone might have a better opinion, and one person could have better experience on the topic you are talking about.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that seeking multiple opinions can help someone is by having more than one right way on how to do something. By having more options open it can help someone handle the decision better from just having one idea. In order to having many ideas you would need to ask people around you for their opinion. With having more than one way on how to do something it can be good in anything you do. Most people like having multiple ideas on a topic because it helps them figure it out better. When people give you more than one way you dont always have to take the more reasonable advice, take the one that you think will help you at the end of the day. In the end having more options to choose from can lead you to success and to making the right decision.\\n\\nAlthough, having more options to choose from is better, someone might have a better opinion to give to you. With someone having a better opinion they could affect the decision in more ways than one. For instance, if your best friend has one idea but another peer has a better approach you would go with the idea that works the best. Sometimes in life the people you that think will have the best advice might not have advice for you at all, so you would have to make the choice yourself or find somebody that you normally wouldnt ask for advice. After all having better opinions on things can help you out more ways than you could imagine.\\n\\nAnother way how asking multiple people for advice can help you make a better decision is that someone might have past experience with the situation. Asking someone that has experience with it can help you make a better and quicker choice than from someone who does not have the experience. People with experience often help those in need of their advice. For example if you ask your parents for advice and they dont know what to tell you, you could ask other family members that would know exactly what to say. Giving advice is sometimes like cheating on a test, it could help you out deeply or it could turn around and hurt you. Always ask someone who has experience with the situation rather than from someone who does not because it could help you out in the long run.\\n\\nIn conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is a good thing to do. Trying new ways to ask for advice can most likely always help you find the advice you really need. As showed asking multiple people for advice is good because it gives you more than one way for something, someone might have a better opinion, and someone could have more experience. Good advice has helped people over the years in different ways and it continues to do so.\\n\\nMost of all asking someone for advice is a key to when you are trying to make a big decision.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0']\n","[\"The idea of online school sounds like a dream to any student in the world. When students hear about online school they think you only do a little bit of school work and that you get to do other things that doesnt involve\\xa0school. In reality, online school is suppose to be the same thing as going to school but your not\\xa0physically\\xa0at school, instead you are learning on a computer. I think the option for students to attend classes online from home would not be beneficial to students. Doing online school at home can be very distracting and this doesn't give students the experience of social interaction with other students.\\n\\nFirst reason why I dont think online school would benefit students is that homes aren't a place where students can focus. When students at a young age are home they aren't as focused like they are in school. There are electronics in homes that can be a huge distraction to students. For example, televisions, phones, and even video games can all be things that keep students from focusing on their school work. When students are home and not doing anything, they will use their electronic devices as a source of entertainment. Electronics can also lead to cheating, if students use their phones they could easily look up the answers online. This keeps them from learning their school material and not develop the skills they need for that class. Another distraction at home that can keep students from focusing on their school work is their parents. Say if a student has a stay at home parent or a parent that works from home then their parents could get in the way of their school work. The parents of these students taking the online school could help them with their classwork or even homework. Sometimes parents think helping your child out is giving them the answers and having them not do any of the work. This doesn't allow students to learn about the classwork their teacher is giving them and letting them take the easy way out of doing it.\\n\\nSecond reason why I disagree with online school is that this can isolate students which also doesn't benefit them. When you take an online school, the whole idea is that you arent going to a school building and sitting in a classroom with other students. I think this isn't okay because this can make young students not develop the skills of talking to others. Talking to people is what we do everyday, schools actually help you with this considering you are in a building full of people who aren't related to you and who you don't know. If students take online school classes then they won't be able to learn how to make friends or how to ask questions when needing help. This can lead to students becoming socially awkward with others or not know how to fit in with a group of students their age.\\n\\nNow on the other hand other people might agree with the idea of online school for students. They would say how it would benefit students who have any social anxieties or anything that involves them not being able to go to school. One example why online school can benefit students is that it can be very helpful to students who have social anxieties. Social anxieties can be hard to deal with when the student who has it is in a new environment surrounded by people they don't know. If there was a student who deals with social anxiety problems then online school would be the better choice for them. They can take their classes at home and not have any problems that would get in the way of their learning. Students who can't come to school for any reason is another example of why online school could benefit students. Some students might travel with their family three weeks to a month and won't be able to attend school. Thats why online school is perfect for them considering they don't have to be in a classroom and can do it online wherever they are. Other students also might not be able to attend school because they want to pursue in an activity or a job that doesn't allow them to go to school. For example, dance academy is really big for ballerinas and dancers who want to pursue in that field. If a student wants to go to dance academy, most of the time their academy will have them dance all day. As a result to that, it leads students not be able to attend school and only have them focus on dance. This is why online school could benefit students who aren't able to physically go to school.\\n\\nIn summary, students would not get more benefits from taking online classes since they can lead to no interaction with others and will be hard for students to stay focus on their work if they aren't in an environment where they can focus. Online school is only good for students who actually need it, going to school is a lot better than taking it online. When you go to school it gives you more opportunities to get help and you get to be surrounded by other students who can also help you.\\xa0\", \"As technology progresses, is the new era of education online? Many students have begun to enroll in online classes where the student learns from home. Distance learning allows students to learn by way of online or video conferencing. I think many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, since online classes allow students to work on their own time, which helps them work on what they struggle, and let's students work on their own schedule.\\n\\nOne benefit of online learning from home is that students can learn and do their work on their own time. A student can spend as much time as they need on any one subject, so the student can allot more time to work on any classes or concepts that they're weak in. Since students don't have to work with a group of 30 other kids trying to get help from the teacher on different topics, the student can work by themselves and shape their education around their own needs. The student won't have to waste time learning something that they already understand.\\n\\nAnother benefit to at-home learning is that students wouldn't have to wake up early to get to school, so they wouldn't be sleep deprived during class. Many students participate in after school activities such as sports or a job, which requires them to get home late, so students often stay up late getting school-work done, then have to wake up and get ready before the sun has risen. This means that many students are tired in class, and aren't able to learn in school. Attending classes from home would eliminate this problem, since students can take classes when they want, at a time that best fits their schedule.\\n\\nSome may argue that attending classes from home would not benefit the student. This is because students won't be able to ask a teacher questions, and won't be able to retain information while looking at a screen. However online classes won't put students at a disadvantage. The students won't have in-person time with a teacher, but they would be able to submit any questions they have online. Also, there is no evidence showing that students can't learn from a screen. In fact, online learning may be a more effective way to learn than sitting in class for 7 hours each day.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning would be beneficial to students because they are able to individually shape their learning, which helps them work on specific concepts that they struggle on. Distance learning is also beneficial because it better accommodates students' schedules and allows students to work on their own time. Online learning is the future of education.\", 'Schools offer distance learning for students to attend class online or video conferencing, do you think students would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Yes, I do believe students taking classes at home would be beneficially factoring to students as online classes offered present time is working very\\xa0well. As well as for parents which can be a cheaper than private school, educational reasons, easier to access,and lots of other reasons.\\n\\nFor example, the online classes and the video conferencing will also mean teachers can work at home if their sick and when the students are sick or out of the country, they can still do their online classes. Students don\\'t have to miss class anymore and not learn because they can still be home and still do all the work as if they were at school. Some students have different speeds of their learning abilities. In online classes they can choose slower or faster pace in learning with online classes they can move until they learn it. The passing rate of students doing online classes is higher than students doing classes at school. Most students have a harder time learning in class due to the pace of learning and understanding. In a video conferencing student will be able to ask more questions, if it was in a smaller work group unlike in school there\\'s one teacher trying to help 28 students in a class and not all their questions would be explained to the students.\\n\\nSome students don\\'t like going to school, if they go to a school that isn\\'t so good it may be dangerous for students. People argue that going to school will cause distractions and different behaviors. Like relationships can get in the way of learning making students skip classes, getting off track of school and affect their abilities to learn. As well as bad influences they can meet at school will make them have different behaviors and change as people. Students could get into gangs and doing things they aren\\'t supposed to. Bullies can affect the students life to not be able to learn in learning environment, constantly getting picked on, making life worst for them, getting physically and mentally hurt, and hurting their self-esteem. Most parents who choose to have their children learning at home is usually because of the school they have in their children going to is likely not the best. Parents cannot move houses to go to a different school or private school as that may be more financially\\xa0hard for them but a better alternate and cheaper way is having school online.\\n\\nSome people may argue that online school or video conferencing will not work because students won\\'t actually pay attention and the distraction at home will be worst than at school. But with the video conferencing the teacher can redirect the student or by using a grading system if they do all their work on time. The students can be graded by doing the work on time as students can be distracted and still understand what their learning.\\xa0Some people may also argue that the students are going to cheat as there will be no teacher with them checking but that will be stopped because students will need to learn the subject because they will take a test and if they don\\'t pass the test, they will not receive the credits of that class. It will be up for the student and the parents for the success of the students passing because he will have the material to be able to learn and it\\'s up to him/her to make sure the student is doing all the work and learning. Students if they don\\'t understand they can talk to a teacher about setting up a time for a video conferencing that will be their \"after school\" as they can do one on one talking with teachers.\\n\\nBe able to attend classes from home will be a great advancement in the learning environment and will be expanded if introduced more. It will ensure safety of students and parents won\\'t worry of whereabouts and what their children are doing. Students will have a easier way of accessing their education and won\\'t need to worry about transportation. Students won\\'t have excuses to miss class because they will be able to do their classes online, anywhere they want. Students will have the insurance of being able to pass as there is a higher passing rate online than in school inside a classroom. This can prove that having class at home is better and can benefit greatly if used correctly.']\n","['Driverless cars could have a very postive impact on the world today. They could be much saver than having humans drivers. Since 2009, there has been cars that could drive independently. Google is the main employer of driverless cars. Driverless cars use sensors to detect traffic, or cars around them. Driverless cars could have a positive impact on the world through less accidents, and provide more safety to the community as a whole.\\n\\nDriverless cars are much saver than human driven cars. There would be no fear of drunk driving, or texting while driving. Driverless cars would get drunk people home safely and you would be able to text in the car without the fear of an accident. \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" This quote shows what driverless cars can do without someone working the wheel. Some sources say that the safest car is one with a human driver in control at all times. I disagree with this opinion because human\\'s can be very dangerous at times. Driverless cars would restrict speeding, and cause many less accidents with their advanced techonology.\\n\\nIf many of these companies thought that Driverless cars would be hurtful, why would they make them? If Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan all think that this would be positive, than we should too. There are many laws that protect the safety of drivers, passengers and pedenstrians. Driverless cars are designed to protect these people. Also, no company will release these cars for sale until they are one hundred percent certain they are safe. \"Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.\" This quote shows the progress google has already had on this subject. This happened in 2009, so I believe that in future years there could be a time where there are no accidents.\\n\\nDriverless cars are already in motion. They are safer, and more reliable than human driven cars. These cars use sensors to help them see where things are around them. In the past, these driverless cars are not completly driverless. If there is bad traffic, or construction, they needed driver assistance. In the future, there will be cars that can move past all of this. Also, they will benefit the enviroment because they would only use half of the fuel used in today\\'s cars. This is why driverless cars would be beneficial to the world today.   ', \"Driverless cars are a new thing in the world.\\n\\nSome people think that the cars are the best thing in the world because you don't have to actually drive, but some other people think that they are a bad idea because they don't trust them.\\n\\nBeing in the driver seat of a driverless car can be stressful.\\n\\nIf the driver didn't trust the car to drive itself then the driver would be freaking out everytime the car applied the gas, breaks or even just turned the wheel.\\n\\nThis invention is very high tech but there are many things that are needed before they are out on the roads.\\n\\nDriverless cars can be dangerous in many ways.\\n\\nSince they are new, there may be some flaws.\\n\\nThe car could accidently apply the gas instead of the breaks and then there would be a crash, or the wheel could turn right instead of left and you would be going the wrong way. That would make the driver frustrated and then they would end up taking over the car and driving themselves anyway.\\n\\nOr what if there is a crash, then who would be responsible for it.\\n\\nWould it be the driver of the driverless car or would it be the manufacturer who designed the car in the first place.\\n\\nThe car could have a malfunction and the driver of the car would be blamed even though they were not even driving the car.\\n\\nRight now the driverless cars are illegal in most states to even test them.\\n\\nSo if they are not tested properly, why would a driver want to risk his/her life when they could just drive themselves and they can guarentee that they know they are going the right way and they would know that the car would stop at a stop sign instead of speeding up.\\n\\nThese cars need to be worked on a few more years before they get released to the public to where they can buy them off a lot.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if the cars are developed properly, it should notify the driver when he/she needs to take over the car.\\n\\nThere are some situations where the driver may need to take over such as in construction or heavy traffic.\\n\\nYou may need to take over when driving through construction to ensure safety.\\n\\nThe car will let you know when you need to take over by vibrating the seat or flashing lights on the windshield.\\n\\nThere is also a safety feature that manufacturers are considering that uses cameras to watch that drivers are always focused on the road even if they are not driving.\\n\\nWhile the driver watches the road, the car will watch the driver to make sure they are still paying attention and that can help improve safety with these cars.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think that driverless cars are dangerous right now, but with more years of development, they may be the new thing of the future.\\n\\nOnce every state in the country allows the cars to be tested, then that will be the next step towards having the cars on the roads and available to the public.\\n\\nBut that may take a few years.\\n\\nThe manufacturers have to make sure the cars have no flaws that could cause an accident and be their fault.\\n\\nBy 2020, some car companies such as Nissan and Audi plan to have cars that can drive themselves.\\n\\nEveryday car manufacturers are getting one day closer to creating driverless cars to the public.\\n\\nBut I think that the cars need to be tested properly before they even think about putting them on the roads.\", 'Can Driverless Cars Truly Be Driverless?\\n\\nDriverless cars throw people off because how could a car be driverless when the driver still has to be paying attention to the road? The driver has to be prepared at all times to be ready to take over the wheel. Drivers can not fully rely on driverless cars because drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, drivers are trusting a computer with their life, and the dangers of bordem behind the wheel.\\n\\nDrivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, even if the \"driverless\" car is driving. The driverless car can not drive through work zones or around accidents, so the driver has to take control. The driver has to stay alert and ready for anything to come their way. The Google car announces when the driver should be ready to take control, but shouldn\\'t a driverless car be able to drive on it\\'s own? Eventhough the car can drive itself, the driver is still in position like they\\'re going to drive too.\\n\\nDrivers are trusting a computer based opperator with their life. What if the car was to get in an accident? Whose fault would it be? Drivers can\\'t fully trust a computer to drive their car because they computer could mess up, and could cause an accident. What if a kid were riding a bike, and were to suddenly fall into the street and the driverless car did not read it? That would cause a big uproar for driverless cars. They are not proven to be 100% safe for the world around us.\\n\\nThe dangers of bordem of not driving could be very serious as well. The driver has to pay attention to the road at all times, but they are not driving. This could cause serious bordem, and could lead to falling asleep behind the wheel. At least when driving is occoured the driver has something to do.\\n\\nNow a driverless car is not a bad idea. The text says that driverless cars use half the fuel that cars use today, and that driverless cars have driven half a million miles without a crash. Driverless cars could be the future, but there would still need to be a lot of work done to the cars to make sure they are completely safe for drivers. Instally cameras in the car would also help with teenagers, and some adults to not be behind the wheel on their phone, which could lead to less accidents. So, driverless cars are a good thing that could come into society.\\n\\nDriverless cars sound dangerous right now, but as technology advances, they could help in the future.

This software detects how other people are feeling even if they are trying to hide their emotions. Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute of Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, is the creator of this expectacular software. The use the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is helpful.\\n\\nThis computer software works with emotion algorithms. According to the passage, \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci\\'s Renaissance painting, was tested with this software. A recent study shows that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry. The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. The text also states that this software can even identify mixed emotions.\\n\\nThe Facial Action Coding System is helpful at schools. With the help of this software, teachers could know when a student is sad or angry. This computer software can also detect mixed emotions. This new software could even save lifes. For example, nowadays with the bullying\\'s situation, a teacher would detect when a student is being bullyied or if the student is under a depression. The teacher could help him and prevent any type of accident. The software can help at schoosl in other ways. The text states, \"\\'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\\' Dr. Hung predicts. \\'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\\'\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System has been developed that improves accuracy in perciving the emotions of others. Making faces reveal so much about the science of emotions. Becuase of this software, teachers could see when a student is sad or angry and the teacher could help him. The software could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. The use the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom is helpful.', 'In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D\\'Alto, technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology should be used in schools to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because being able to identify what might be bothering others could be beneficial. Young adults could be facing something serious in their life but may not have the right words to express how they feel. Finding help for those feeling down is difficult. Using this technology could help those in need. This technology can help with identifying if a student is happy or worried, being able to have fun and put a smile on a students face while using this technology, and being able to identify if a student is confused or bored.\\n\\nThe Facial Action Coding System can help with students and their emotions. \"Of course, most students would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.\" (5). Not everyone can tell what an individual is feeling. The help of this technology can help those who need it most. It can help detect if a student is happy or worried, but it can also put a smile on someones face.\\n\\nUsing this technology can help put a smile on your face in many ways. \"The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face.\" (6). A lot of technology used today can put a smile on someone\\'s face. Video games, social media, etc. Using the Facial Action Coding System is beneficial in many ways as well. It can help with being productive, getting help for a student who might need it. Technology can help with putting a smile on a students face, but it can also help with identifying if a student is confused or bored.\\n\\nTechnology can help identify if a student is confused or bored and could also help them for later in the future. \"\\'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\\'\" (6). Being able to identify a students emotions in a school could possibly help the student with getting better grades, feeling better about themselves, and passing each day with positivity. It can be difficult for a student to explain how they feel to another. The Facial Action Coding System has multiple ways on finding a solution for many problems that students are faced with today. This technology can help detect if a student is confused or bored, if a student is happy or worried, and being able to have fun with this technology.\\n\\nToday, many students are faced with difficult times. Students have to deal with so much during their schooling years and having difficult emotions to deal with also. The Facial Action Coding System could be very benificial to students and others. It can help with the problems that might hold them back from doing their best in school. This technology could help identify a student who is happy or worried, being able to have fun while using this technology, and being able to identify if a student is confused or bored.                  ', 'Everyone in the world makes different facial expressions everday. It\\'s not necessarily something people try to do, but it is a natural way to express emotion. New technology called Facial Action Coding System allows doctors and scientists to evaluate people\\'s facial expressions as a way of telling how they are feeling. Administrators should use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom because it is valuable in ways such as engaging students in lessons, being able to tell if a student is experiencing negative emotions, and it will help students learn about facial expressions and what they mean.\\n\\nOne reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom is because it would keep students engaged in lessons. In the article, it says that the computer program would have the ability to see when a student is getting bored or confused. Once it recognized this, it would reengage them in the lesson. This is the same things teachers do, but if a teacher was busy with another student, the computer just completed the task for them. This would be an effective way for students to continue their learning in an innovative way.\\n\\nAnother reason the Facial Action Coding System would be useful in the classroom would be that the technology would be able to tell if the student was experiencing negative emotions. If someone knows their friend well, they are likely going to notice if they seem sad or downtrodden. However, if their friend is trying to hide their emotions, they might not even know something is wrong. On the other hand, if the computer systems were in the classroom, it would be able to tell if their were other negative emotions hidden from the human eye such as depression. This is evident from the article when it says that the Mona Lisa painting is, \"83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry\"(D\\'Alto). These results could be surprising to some because to the normal human eye the Mona Lisa seems completely happy and few would guess she\\'s actually angry or fearful. So, this would help administators know if there was emotionally something they could do to help their students.\\n\\nThe final reason the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms is because it could teach students about recognizing facial expressions in people and what they mean. So, the technology is not only useful because it helps the students\\' emotional health, but also because it could help students help each other. If students learn how the computer tells how people are feeling, and they do the same, then the students will be able to recognize emotions and attain help for people they might think need emotional support. This would go above what humans are able to tell about how people feel on a regualar basis.\\n\\nSo, the\\n\\nFacial Action Coding System would be useful in classrooms for a plethora of reasons. For one, it would recgonize if students were straying away from the lesson, and it would pull them back in. Also, the technology would be able to detect negative emotions within a student which could be presented to the teacher so they could help the student. Finally, the technology would be able to inform students on how to recognize emotions of people and could teach them all of the science and technological aspects of the sofware. This innovative facial technology could help students a trememdous amount in the classroom.    ']\n","['Ever since cars were invented, they have widely been used as the primary source of transportation. They became so commonplace that their widespread use started to introduce negative impacts . As a result, some countries, or cities, have recently put in place programs or events to limit, or decrease, the amount of car usage in that area. There are many advantages to limiting car usage, including that not using cars is better for the environment and that it allows the city to improve itself.\\n\\nIn recent years, the environment has become a worldwide concern; one of the advantages to limiting car usage is that it will positively impact the environment. Today, people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s essay \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", she writes, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world\\'s population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one.\\n\\nAdditionally, the limited use of cars opens many opportunities for cities to improve themselves by adding new features or improving upon old ones. In the article \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed. The changes are a direct result of the city\\'s Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, \"It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city\\'s mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\".\\xa0 These additions are in response to the city\\'s inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay \"In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars\". She writes, \"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs\". One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending. The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself.\\n\\nThere are many advantages to limiting car use. Not only does it improve the environment by removing smog and reducing greenhouse gas emission, but it also allows the area to improve itself by building new features. For this reason, limited car use should be seen as an overall positive idea.    ', 'In todays society driving or riding in a car is a completely normal activity. \\xa0You drive to school, work, extracurricular activities, social gatherings, and everything else that doesnt happen in your own home. \\xa0Cars are a part of everyday life.\\n\\nWhat if I told you that there a cities that are banning car usage? \\xa0Vauban in Germany is a suburb that has given up cars. \\xa0Paris banned driving for a few days to reduce smog. \\xa0Bogata, Columbia initiated an annual \"car-free day.\" \\xa0Cities all over the world are giving up cars and looking to other forms of transportation. \\xa0So why limit car usage? Well, the usage of cars produces O-zone harming greenhouse gass emissions, smog, traffic jams, and adds\\xa0stress to the our everyday lives.\\n\\nA large amount of the harmful greenhouse gas emissisions that surround\\xa0the earth come directly from cars. \\xa0According\\xa0to source 1 \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" \\xa0By ending the use of even a fraction of our car usage we would drastically improve the amount of gas emissions produced. \\xa0This improvement would mean healthier air and a healthier O-zone.\\n\\nIn Paris, France pollution and smog is a big problem. \\xa0Source 2 states that Paris has much more smog than other European capital cities. \"Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london.\" \\xa0Because of this intense smog Paris created a partial driving ban policy to help clear and clean the city air. \\xa0The policy stated that on Monday vehicles with an even-mumbered lincense plate would have to leave their cars at their home or be issued a 22-euro fine. \\xa0The next day this rule would apply to odd-numbered licence plates. \\xa0As a result to this partial ban the city smog and congestion levels decreased by 60 percent. \\xa0Even this partial change benefited the city greatly by reducing smog and poor air quality.\\n\\nOne growing trend in some cities in South America is \"car-free day.\" \\xa0Source 3\\xa0describes how \"cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted.\" The objective of this day is to enchorage the usage of public transportation. \\xa0This day was \"a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" according to one businessman by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza. \\xa0He is right. \\xa0Cars are an added stress to a busy day. \\xa0While driving there is a constant fear of being involved in an accident, getting lost, popping a tire, or having your car break down. \\xa0There is also the nuisance of heavy stop-and-go traffic, bad drivers, and uncooperative lights. \\xa0When the amount of cars on the road is reduced there are less bad drivers, less traffic jams, and less stress. \\xa0That also means that safety is improved so there are less accidents.\\n\\nBy limiting their car usage many cities have improved their enviroments and their lives. \\xa0In all these cities greenhous gas levels are reduced, the smog levels in Paris have fallen, safety in these cities has improved, and the stress of transportation has become less of an issue. With all of these advantages is there really a question why these cities have been limiting car usage? When you think about\\xa0the advantages of reducing\\xa0private transportation these vehicle bans make perfect sense.    ', \"Almost everyone owns a car because people are traveling constantly to get from point A to point B. No matter who it may be, that person at some point in their lives needs some way to get around. Everyday people need to either go to the store, pick up their kids, go to work, go to school, you name it. That doesn't mean that owning a car is a necessity, all around the world many people are trying to cut down and limit their car usage by having a whole lot of other options. There are buses, people can car pool, walk, skate, bike, and many more. People are coming to the conclusion that if we, as a whole, decide to start cutting down on our usage of cars it can benefit the way we live.\\n\\nLots of people actually don't mind not having a car just yet. Most teenagers do want to get their license and a car but there's so much other things they need to focus on. It really is not a priority for them because they have school, work, plus if they do need to get somewhere they can always take the bus and get a ride from a friend (Source 4). In Germany, there is a city by the name of Vauban, that is known to be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life (Source 1). Vauban's goal and idea, which is to cut down on cars for a better living, has made it'a way around the world, so that other states and countries can aspire to do the same and little by little we could have a world that is not so dependent on cars. The idea of using cars, for some, it causes them stress and they're always tense, not using a car makes them happier, as stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two (Source 1). The stress aspect of this could be due to the fact that in the most recent years, the percentage of car crashes and accidents have gone up. Many people abhor the idea of using cars because they have been in an terible accident themselves or someone close to them. Also, it can even just be all the traffic jams that occur during rush hour, which makes people late and accidents do happen. For example in Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to their designated location, to leave the streets due to traffic jams (Source 3). Since they knew that lots of their citizens were deciding not to use cars they started making uneven, pitted sidewalks into nice, smooth, replaced ones for them (Source 3).\\n\\nAnother reason why people want to limit their usage on cars is because of all the pollution cars create. Passenger cars are rsponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 1). Not many people think about the effects of air pollution like smog, but it is a big deal. Since people don't think about it often, there is no way for the majority of us to try and find a solution to put into action to stop it or help it go down. In Paris, there was a partial driving ban to clear the air around the city (Source 2). Paris' partial ban was their idea to try and make their city a better place. With the ban being enforced and put into play there\\xa0 were about 4,000 drivers fined (Source 2). It turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion, car traffic, had gone down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after five days of less smog pollution and Paris is typically known to have more smog than any other European capitals (Source 2). This goes to show, that slowly people are actually becoming aware of what's going on and they actually care enought to try and make things better.\\n\\nAll in all, there are many ways to try and cut down on our car usage for the better. It can be anything from not buying as many cars, to deciding to not use cars at all and deciding to walk, skate, and bike, etc. Not only will limiting our car usage as a whole stop traffic jams, car accidents, air pollution, and more, it will help to benefit our lives for the better whether or not people want to believe it. If things keep going from here, and more and more decide that less car usage is better than over a time span of let's say 20-30 years, there could be a lot less dangerous things occuring in our lives.    \"]\n","['Venus is the closest planet to Earth. The planet Venus is known as Earth\\'s twin because its the close to earth density and size, and is also sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus.\" The author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The aurthour says in paragraph 4 that Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary vist. The author also says that Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have many forms of like, like Earth. The author also says in paragraph 8 that our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\\n\\nI think that we should not waste our time to explore Venus. Even though the planet is somewhat identical to Earth, the planet is very chaotic and dangerous. In paragraph 3, the author tells the readers the many dangers of Venus. The planet is covered in a thick atmosphere of about 97 carbon dioxide, and the atmosphere has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The planet\\'s surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what Earth is. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature in our solar system, considering that Mercury is the closet planet to the sun. The weather on Venus also has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. Yes we can look and take samples, but the spacecraft we sent to Venus has not survived the landing for more than a couple of hours. We could vist Venus, but it could be nearly impossible with Venus conditions.\\n\\nVenus, Earth\\'s \"twin,\" is similar to Earth in size and density. But the clouds and temperatures make it nearly impossible to live on Venus. We sent many spacecraft to Venus, but none could survive for a couple of hours. The conditions of the planet is chaotic, and the atmosphere is as toxic as it could get. Astronomers think that Venus was probably covered with oceans and had life on the planet. Venus today, has a rocky surface, which includes valleys, mountains, and craters. We should study the chaotic planet, but living conditions are nearly impossible.', 'Exploring Venus clearly has it\\'s challenges. The exploration of an unknown area always has benefits with the information that can be uncovered, but it is almost never easy. Planets in general all hold many barriers for studying done by scientists and researchers. The author of this article suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by proving that Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, and that Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit. The author also claims that The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a solution to make visiting Venus safer.\\n\\nFirst of all, the author says that Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the text, it says, \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\" Venus is or once was clearly somewhat similar to Earth, and that will help scientists to be able to find out information about our own planet along with another planet that may seem the most reasonable to study. In the text, it also says,\"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probabnly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" All of these characteristics of Venus make the planet more interesting and reasonable for studying. Considering the fact that the planet is very similar to Earth, the planet may also give us insight of our own planet, with the similarities that can and have already been drawn.\\n\\nSecondly, Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit. In the text, it says, \"Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.\" This clearly proves that studying Venus is worth the pursuit because it is not going to take as long as other planets will to get to. Traveling in space, as the author said, can take a very long time, and that makes Venus a lot more accessible than most other planets. Studying Venus cuts down a major barrier that scientists and astronomers would have to work around for many other planets, and that is time.\\n\\nLastly, NASA has a solution to make studying Venus safe. In the text, it says, \"NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" NASA\\'s solution solves many problems with studying Venus. The many factors like air pressure, heat, and radiation are lowered to survivable numbers for humans. Without this solution from NASA, the conditions of Venus are not survivable for a time period long enough to actually gain any information about the planet. In the text, it also explains that scientists and researchers would need to get up closer in order to actually gain insight about the planet. Although this is true, NASA is working on other solutions like simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that can last for up to three weeks in the conditions of Venus. All of these solutions can help to make studying Venus less risky and dangerous, and therefore worth the risk.\\n\\nIn conclusion, studying Venus provides a true challenge to scientists, researchers, and more. The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" provides evidence to researchers and scientists that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is or was very similar to Earth. The author also says that Venus is accessible because of it\\'s distance from Earth and the time it would take to reach it. The author also provides NASA\\'s solutions to the dangers of studying Venus. The advantages of studying Venus have been proven, but much must be done before any up close studying will occur.', 'In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents. The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\\n\\nThe author claims that the idea of inhabiting Venus is worthy due to its similarity to Earth. Paragraph 4 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could\\'ve supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author\\'s claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author\\'s idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.\\n\\nAlthough Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). As stated, the conditions would not be easy for humans, but survivable at the least. This supports the author\\'s claim because this proves human life could be achieveable overall. This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author\\'s claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.\\n\\nSome issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus\\'s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, \"The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus. The author\\'s claim is supported in this statement because it is a simple solution to technology on Venus. There are very few rebuttals that overcome the postive effects of pursuing Venus.\\n\\nWith all the easy fixes, solutions and prep planned for Venus, the author\\'s claim is overwhelmingly supported. The author proved Venus is certainly a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The positive outcomes outweigh the negatives in almost every aspect of this idea. There are multiple reasons presented in \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" that prove attempting to explore Venus has a more successful outlook than not. Throughout the article, the facts and claims highly support the author\\'s claim of Venus being a worthy planet to pursue.']\n","[\"Summer break is all about fun and hanging out with friends. But it is important for students to continue to learn during this period. The smallest things can help students continue their education during break. This task can be made possible if students could design their own projects\\xa0rather than relying on the teachers. The summer projects should not be teacher-designed because instructors control class and projects during the school year. One project that is student-designed will give the students a turn to control the expectations and rubric. If students could manage and design their own projects, it would give them an opportunity to create something that expresses their interests while enjoying their summer break.\\n\\nWhen students are let out of school for summer break they are looking forward to the time off from school. The warm weather makes it fun to hang out with friends outdoors and go swimming. But if teachers were create and design a project for students to complete then that would be taking the fun out of summer break. It would be a hassle for students to be required to complete a teacher-designed project rather than the students designing the requirements and topic for the project. If the students have to take time out their summer to complete a project then it should designed by them. During the entire school year students are required to complete assignments at their instructors expense. Students are in school for more than half of the year, it is important that they can enjoy their lengthy summer break without being controlled by their teachers. If the students are required to complete a project during their summer break then it should be designed by the students. Summer break is meant to give students time to relax from stressful, hefty homework. It would be unfair to students if they were required to complete a project that was teacher-designed due to the importance for students to experience a stress-free break rather than worrying about due dates for assignments and tests.\\n\\nSummer work is no fun for any student. It will be hard to convince any student to continue their education during their summer break because summer is all about no homework or projects. A way around that issue is giving the students a chance to complete the project at their own pace and interest. Any summer projects or assignments for students should be based around their interest rather than teachers interest. During the summer students will be busy having fun with friends, going on vacation or enjoying their time off from school. If a teacher assigns students an assignment or project that is not appealing, the chances of the students putting 100% effort into the project is slim. Also, the chances of students actually completing a teacher-based project efficiently\\xa0is slim as well. But, if it was a student-designed project, the completion rate would skyrocket due to the fact the students would actually want to do the summer work. It will be hard for students to motivate and push themselves to complete a project if it is boring. Teacher-design summer work would be unfair to students that would like to control their education and topic. Projects and assignments based on the students interest would exemplify\\xa0better work ethic and dedication. It is important for students to continue learning during the summer, but it should be learning based on their interests and goals\\xa0rather than any teacher.\\n\\nIt would not be a good decision to let students design and control their own summer projects or assignments because it is important students are learning the correct material necessary for class. It would be pointless for students to complete a summer assignment or project if it was not based on the school's curriculum. A teacher-designed project would be more beneficial for the students than allowing the students to design their own project, The instructors are aware of the things the students will be required to learn during the school year. If the teachers would be allowed to control the summer work then it would give the students a head start\\xa0on the upcoming material in their classes. Overall, the teacher's should control the requirements and rubric for the summer work because the students would learn things that are related to school rather than researching things that are irrelevant to anything they would be exposed to during the school year.\\n\\nMoreover, students should be given the freedom to choose any topic for their summer work rather than letting the teachers design the projects. Summer is about free time and preparing for the next school year to come. But, if students had to worry and stress about a difficult, teacher-deigned project then it would be sucking the fun out of summer break. It would be unfair for teachers to require students to complete an assignment based on the instructors expectations. It would be easier for students to show their hobbies and interests through a project that they would enjoy rather than letting the instructor choose.\\xa0\", \"As the end of a school year comes to a close, the summer is just beginning. Many during summer use it as a time to have fun and take a break from school. Some schools though require students to complete a summer project to ensure learning continues throughout the year. This can help to make sure that the student mind is awake and ready to learn when the start of the new school year begins. The basis for summer projects to assure continuous learning should be student-designed because creative projects would be produced and it would give students an opportunity to take control of their education.\\n\\nDuring the school year, students go from class to class completing the required work to excel. In most cases, this requires sitting through a lecture followed by an activity and homework. All of which are teacher-designed. For this reason, summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education. Students would learn the responsibility of completing a project without a teacher telling them the process they should follow. The students would have to research and create a project based on something that they are passionate about. For example, every student has their own interest such as baking, rocketry, and architecture. With student-designed summer projects, each student can complete their own individualized project based on their own interests. As to where a teacher-designed project the student has to go with what the teacher assigns. If the teacher is interested in types of frogs, students would have to complete a project based on the interest of the teacher. Student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education.\\n\\nWhen a teacher assigns a project, there are strict guidelines on how the project should be completed. To combat the harsh guidelines, a student-designed project would create more creative projects. For example, if there are 20 students in a class with one teacher and the teacher assigns a project, there will be 20 of the same project that return because of the guidelines that the teacher established when creating the project. But if every one of the 20 students got to design their own project, there will be 20 different projects that come back to be presented. This will happen because the students will feel more personally connected to their project. Students won't feel as if it is a project the teachers gave them but rather something fun to do over the summer. Having a summer project that is designed by an individual, the teacher, for a group, the students, will create a detriment\\xa0to creativity.\\n\\nSome may argue that if summer projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers could regulate and prepare the students better for the upcoming school year. This may be true, but considering that throughout the normal school year teachers design and assign work to students, it would be more beneficial to give students the opportunity to learn how to take charge of their own work. Continuing to have teachers dictate the types of projects students complete year round will not prepare them for the world.\\xa0A student-designed project would prepare students better for the world. Once the students enter the world, there won't always be a teacher telling them how to complete the task assigned to them. Giving students the opportunity to experience independence over the summer is a perfect way to prepare them for the world. Preparing students for the world out of school is more important than preparing them for a few weeks in the future when school starts.\\n\\nSchools that require students to complete a summer project should make the projects student-designed. Student-designed projects would cause for more creative projects compared to teacher-designed projects, and it would give students the opportunity to take charge of their education. Having summer projects to insure students continuous learning is a terrific way to enhance a students education. But done incorrectly, it can cause a student to dread school more. A well executed summer project would be student-designed, where the student gets to decide on their own project based on an interest of their liking. Making sure that students are positively active in their education is crucial to developing a well rounded individual.\", \"Summer break can lead to a fallback in students' learning from the previous year. In order to combat this problem, many schools have projects for the students over summer break to ensure that students maintain the skills that they learned in school. Some of these projects might require a lot of work, while others are less labor intensive. However, one thing is true for all of these projects. They should be student designed because this insures that the students will be engaged with the project, gives teachers a better understanding of what students are passionate about, and is the most fair way to give students work over a break.\\n\\nHaving students design their own projects will ensure that the project is something that the students actually enjoy doing. Firstly, because they have choice in what they do, the students will be able to pick a subject or manner of presentation that they are excited about. If the teacher were to assign the same project to every student without allowing the students to have any say in what they actually end up doing, there would defiantly be students who are not interested in the project. Secondly, the students will also understand the project better. The students will have designed their own project, so they will know exactly what the outcome is supposed to be like and how to get there. Many projects are hard for students because they are not actually aware of what they are intended to do, so by allowing the students to design their own project, the school ensures that the students will completely comprehend it. Lastly, having the project be designed by students means that the students will be given more opportunity for creativity. Because the students more liberty over their project, they will be able to use more of their own unique ideas in the project.\\n\\nAllowing students to design their own project is also better for the teachers. First of all, the teachers responsible for grading the project will be given an opportunity to better understand their students before the school year ever starts. This understanding is because students are allowed to express themselves more through a project they designed themselves. Secondly, the teachers will not have to worry about making different projects for different levels of students, or about having to make a project that will interest many different types of students because the students will be responsible for making the project work for their level of understanding and interests. Lastly, the teachers will be provided a time to learn things that they would not have a chance to learn otherwise. This is because the students are given the opportunity for creativity, so they may choose to do a project about something that a teacher may have know previous knowledge of.\\n\\nAllowing students to design their own summer projects is a more fair way to assign work over the summer holiday. To begin, the students have been completing teacher designed work all school year, so it is only fair to give the students a break and allow them to design their own projects. Additionally, the projects are assigned as work over the summer, so they should not feel like the same work that students are being assigned all year long. Because the students have been working very diligently over the year to complete many different types of assignments from teachers. It would not be fair to the students to essentially continue that trend of assignments into the vacation. Finally, a student designed projects allows for more flexibility. This flexibility allows the students the opportunity to create a project that will be conducive to a busy summer schedule. Many students have to travel or go to summer camps, so they mightn not be able to complete to work which a teacher who does not know the summer plans of a students designs. However, it the student designs their own project, they will be able to make it work with their summer schedule.\\n\\nIf a school assigns a summer project to their students, the project should be student designed. there re many different ways to continue learning when formal school is on a break, but a student designed project will allow for creativity, flexibility, and be better for teachers as well as students. Above all, schools should focus on educating students in a way that allows them creating and ensure that they are passionate about what they learn, if not students will never develop a life long love of education.\"]\n","[\"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that policy 1 is the best policy to enforce about cell phones. This policy will allow us to contact our parents or friends if needed. The use of cell phones in class is wrong but having them during lunch will not cause disruptions. Cell phones can be an annoyance during class but having them when not in class is perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nCell phones are disruptive to teachers and other students during class. If a phone goes off while others are trying to learn it interrupts their attention and annoys the teacher. However having cell phones during lunch or free periods would not disrupt any learning because you are not in a classroom. As long as cell phones are turned off and not being used during class time I see no reason why students should not be allowed to have them.\\n\\nIf a student gets sick or needs something having a cell phone with them can let them call home to contact someone. Even though they can call from the office having a cell phone on hand is a quicker and easier way to contact somebody. Also if a student has some kind of after school practice and can't have their phone with them at school then they won't be able to let their parent know if practice is running late or will finish early. Cell phones are necessary for students to have.\\n\\nPolicy 2 states that students can not have phones at school at all. If you choose policy 2 then students will still bring their phones and use them even more. Teenagers do what they are told not to do. If you tell us we can't have our phones that will just make us want to have them more. Policy 2 will just create more cell phone usage at school and more disruptions to the learning environment.\\n\\nAs you can see I believe that policy 1 is the best policy to enforce at this school. It will let students have their phones outside of class and they can have them if they need to contact some one. Even though cell phones are a nuisance to class this policy only lets you have them when you are not in class. Cell phones are necessary for contacting a parent or just for texting a friend. This is why policy 1 is the best policy for our school.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\", \"Dear TEACHER_NAME,\\n\\nI understand that you are considering two possible policies that have to do with using cell phones in school. I think that you should think of allowing students to bring phones to school and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. thirty percent of the population of children are getting in trouble in school because of the use of cell phones in school.\\n\\nFirst of all, if students have cell phones then they will be tempted to use it and might get in trouble if they use it in class secretly because they are not allowed to use them in school. Lets say that students are in class and they feel the urge to text because they have not used the phone that day. They will want to use it in class but they will do it secretly so the teacher wont take it away. For example there was this kid in my class and while we were in the middle of the lesson he would take out the phone while the teacher had her back to us and start using it. If you put the policy that will let us use our cell phones in school during lunch periods and free time then we will have enough texting done so that we will not need to text anymore until school is finished or until their next free time.\\n\\nSecond of all, if we were able to use our phones in lunch periods or free times then what will be the point of students getting in trouble all the time because of cell phones. Just think about it, if students aren't able to use their phones in school at all then they will use it no matter what the case is because they feel the urge to do it. They will feel the need to do it because either they receive text that will make them want to reply back or they become so obsessed with using them that they think that they have to use it.\\n\\nLastly, you wont have teachers complaining about their students not paying attention in class due to the fact that the students are always on their cell phones. Most teachers have to stop the lesson because they have to waste their time taking students cell phones away. If you put the policy that students can use their phones at free times and lunch periods then teachers wont be interrupted anymore and will just have to worry about teaching the students about what they have to learn to pass to the next grade.\\n\\nFinally, that is why it would be a great idea to put the policy that will let the students use their cell phones at free times and lunch periods. I mean sure if students aren't allowed to use their phone at all because of school rules then they might be willing to not use it because they wouldn't want it taken away. But just think about the amount of students that will be able to pay attention in class because they won't need to use their phone. I hope you take my letter to consideration and put a policy that will allow students to use their phones freely during free times and lunch periods.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\", 'To the principal,\\n\\nYou should consider changing the call phone policy to Policy 1.\\n\\n\"Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.\"\\n\\nPolicy 1 should be picked because the policy allows students to bring cell phones into school as sometimes students need to use their cell phones after school. Students keeping their cell phones off during class time but allowing students to bring the cell phones in school will allow students to contact their parents after school. Policy 2 does not allow students to bring their cell phones into school is too restrictive on students. Allowing cell phone use during lunch and other free time is also a good idea. Students can use the phones to contact other people outside school and can contact heir parents if they need to. They can also be contacted during their free time by family members to give them news that they would not know until after school when they get home.']\n","['The Landform that Looks like a Face\\n\\nOn Earth, there are many landforms that might look like a person or a thing. On Mars, there is a landform that looks like a face. This Face has had several photos of it taken by Viking 1 in 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) in 1998, and another (MGS) in 2001. The Face looks like a face because of its characteristics. Although it looks like an enourmous head, it is really just a mesa or butte, a landform, that happens to look like a face.\\n\\nOne reason that this landform is not a face is because NASA revealed a close up picture of the face, revealing only a landform. That picture had a caption that stated, \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Before, there were pictures that weren\\'t as high resolution, so it looked like a face but is now proven to be just a landform. This shows that the landform that looks like a face, is just a landform since there is a photo that shows what the \"face\" actually is. This means the face is just a mesa or butte.\\n\\nAnother reason why this Face is just a natural landform, is because this landform is in Cydonia where mesas are common. The text states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharoah.\" This shows that mesas in Cydonia are common. Also, the mesa just had unusual shadows that gave it the appearence of a face. This means that this face was just a landform.\\n\\nAnother reason, is that some landforms, like on Earth look like something other than a landform. The text states, \"\\'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\\', says Garvin.\" This shows that some landforms can represent or look different from what it really is. This would be the Face oon Mars that is a landform. This wouldn\\'t be a face.\\n\\nThough some people, like cospiracy theorists, may say that NASA wants to hide a type of evidence for life on Mars, they are wrong. The text states,\"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence for life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say cospiracy theorists.\" The text also states, \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" NASA responds to conspiracy theorist in this way, because if NASA were to be responsible for discovering life on Mars, they would benefit. This shows that though NASA would like to be responsible fo discovering life on Mars, NASA just wanted to prove that this Face is just a natural landform.\\n\\nOverall, there are several reasons why this Face is just a natural landform. One of them is that NASA took a picture of the Face, revealing just a landform. Another reason, is that mesas are common in Cydonia, the area where the Face was found. Another reason, is that thhis landfprm like others can look different from what it really is. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landform.', 'The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. There is no proof whatsoever of any signs of life on Mars, which means no aliens. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that coincidently looks like a human face. Given the shadows and shape, the Face very much looks like it has a human nose mouth, and eyes. Although up close, there is no resemblence of a human face. Therefore, do not let this anyone fool you.\\n\\nPictures have been taken by NASA of the Face to prove it is just a natural landform. Pictures taken from 1976 appear blurry, and not clear, so it is easy to believe that aliens created the Face. Although, in 1998, the pictures taken aren\\'t as blurry, and you can see the structure of the landfrom clearly. Lastly, the picture taken in 2001 is clear and visible. You can perfectly see that close up, the Face is just another natural landform on Mars. From far away, it looks like a human face because of the shadows, but up close, it is nothing more than a simple landform.\\n\\nFurthermore, on 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to looks for the Face again. When they snapped a photo of it, it was indeed \"ten times sharper than the photo taken in 1976.\" This revealed that it was just a natural landform when the photo appeared online. \"There was no alien monument after all.\"\\n\\nSome people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that \"alien markings were hidden by haze\", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken. Since it was winter in April 1998, it was also the \"cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" Therefore, the camera used had to \"peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.\" This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it\\'s the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face.\\n\\nPlus, when NASA took another picture in 2001, it was taken using the \"camera\\'s absolute maximum solution.\" Based on what I read, \"each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" There simply can\\'t be anything you can miss using the camera\\'s absolute maximum solution. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Program, even said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could what they where!\"\\n\\nFinally, NASA\\'s explanation about the Face on Mars is based on credible information and research. People who believe aliens created the Face often get the information inside their head, making up crazy theories that aren\\'t actually true. Furthermore, NASA went on missions to prove that the Face isn\\'t made by aliens. They took high-quality photos that show that it is just a natural landscape. Besides making things up on their own, skeptics probably take information from the internet on websites that other skeptics have made about aliens creating the Face. You can never trust the internet, and the skeptics who made these websites probably put down their own made up facts and theories to get people to join their side.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just extraordinarily shaped to look like a human head, with shadows to create the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth from far away. Up close, there is not resemblence of a human face at all. Pictures, missions, and years of research have proved it. Plus, there were no signs of aliens, or any life on Mars when they conducted this research. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.', 'Twenty five years ago, NASA\\'s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. While snapping photos of possible landing sites, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nThe face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, \"Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.\" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars.\\n\\nThe land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, \"On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \\'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Mailin\\'s team an extraordinary photo using the camera\\'s absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" The text also states that, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were any objects in this picure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens.\\n\\nSome say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, \"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it ws winter in April \\'98-a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" These text peices show that since it was a cloudy time, the alien markings weren\\'t revealed which makes them believe that the face was created by aliens. However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform.\\n\\nIn conclusion, 25 years ago, a face had been seen on Mars by pictures from the Vinking that is a natural landform and looks similar to a human face. Some say that the landform was created by aliens, but there is proof that aliens had no part in the formation what so ever. Few scientists believe that it\\'s a alien artifact but with pictures, alien markings would have been noticed. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.']\n","[\"Dear Principal,\\n\\nHelping out the community is always a good thing to do.\\n\\nSome people like helping, but others don't. I understand that people are busy with other things and might not have time to help the community, but little things you do help.\\n\\nTherefore, i think that the students should perform community service.\\n\\nIf you have something else going on like sports for example, you could take a day off from them to help the community. Some people don't even play sports because they can't afford it, so think how they feel. If the students helped out the community, i think the community would appreciate it, and be thankful that the kids took time out of their schedule to help them.\\n\\nCommunity service doesn't take long, the longest it would take is a day. After you do community service you feel good because you know you helped people.\\n\\nEven if theirs certain things you don't like doing for community service, there's many things that you could choose from.\\n\\nI know i would feel good if people helped me out, and the people you are helping will feel good too. As a principal you should encourage the kids to do community service. It will help them become better people. I mean i know, I'm a kid and i know doing community service isn't the most fun thing. I could be doing something better. No one likes doing service.\\n\\nAfter you get done with it, you do feel good inside and you know that you helped people have a better life. There's always little things that you could do to help out in the community. Even recycling. You help out the community a lot doing that because you are cleaning our world. People should recycle more often and it would make our place cleaner and healthier to live in. We do community service in my school. We do it every year as a class. I think that even one day a year helps people out a lot. I would say that you should have your students do community service. It would help out everyone there, and they would be happy that you came to help them out.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\", \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI have heard you are making a decision of whether to require community service or not. I think that if you require it, it would do a good deal on the community. First of all, if just one whole school did community service, many people would be grateful, the town would be much cleaner, and the school would become more popular.\\n\\nIf you required community service,\\n\\nI don't think that kids would get that mad about it.\\n\\nI think it would make them feel better about themselves and help them in the future. Community service isn't just about doing it because you have to, it is about doing something good community, because if you do, it will reflect back on you.\\n\\nIf the service wasn't required then the kids who don't do it will never do it because they were never engaged into the idea. The kids who never did it will think that you should only do community service if you have to not just as a grateful act. Community service is about doing it in your time. you use the time you have to do something good for you, your friends, and your community.\\n\\nIt would make the community a better environment for upcoming students and teachers, who will try to follow what previous students and teachers have done. Doing community service can help you in the future to. You might be a better person all around from being near community service. Even little thing that people do everyday make peoples lives better.\\n\\nAny one can do community service, even little kids. So I am trying to persuade you into requiring community service. It will help your community in many different ways.\", 'students and community service dear principal\\n\\nThis letter is debating if students should have to perform community service or not. Some reasons people would want to perform community service is to make kids more responsible and feel like they have helped the community and themselves. What think is that they should have a selected number of kids do the community service and see if it will impact or effect there grades or behavior at school.\\n\\nSome reasons why the principal should let students perform community service is to give back to the community. Also another reason why they should do community service is that it might help them in school the way they act and how they are. The school should keep track and see if the community service is helping the kids on who they are or not.\\n\\nThese are some reasons why they should keep the community service around so it could help kids and there community. Community service can help the community and yourself if we all do community service it will help our community. This principal should keep community service at there school.']\n","[\"Phones & Driving\\n\\nShould people use their phones while driving? Well 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. People are so distracted by their phones they forget about their own safety at risk while driving. While you're driving you should be more focused on the road and your surrounds more than a Facebook notification. It's not only teens that do this adults as well use their phones while driving. It is one of the leading reasons of car accidents today. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're putting others in risk as well. So should you use your phones while driving I think not.\\n\\nTexting and driving is one of the most dangerous forms of distracted driving. In fact, the average text sent or read in a car takes a driver's eyes off the road for 5 seconds. This is more than enough time to get in a life-altering accident.

The penalty for a first offense for violating the texting law is a fine of $20 to $400 and up to four points on the driving record of the offender. So are you sure you willing to pay the fine or do the time for texting while driving. It really isn't worth it you can wait until you get to your destination. There more things important than your phone while you're driving like the road than an Instagram notification.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving doesn't only put the driver at risk, but also everyone else on the road. Take for example the many young students who have died while driving because they were texting. Looking around while driving, you can see people distracted by their cell phones. These people are not only teenagers but also adults. The shocking truth is that texting while driving increases the chances of crashing by over 23 times normal driving. People have a longer response time when they text. Then the passengers may not be looking at the road because they may be on their phones. On average, an accident happens within two to three seconds when the driver is texting. So if you do get into an accident you could do major damages to another person car or worse you could cause severe health damage to the other person that was in the other vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year including the other that got was in the accident because of the bad driver.\\n\\nThere are many reason on why texting while driving is very useful. Here's seven reasons to stop using your phone and driving it puts innocent lives at risk, it puts your life at risk, it is comparable to, if not worse than, driving under the influence ,you are more likely to crash, it's very easy to simply pull over, you are setting a bad example for children and it is often illegal. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. As long as their use does not distract you from focusing on the road and you do not have to touch the phone. Using your phone when your car is stationary at traffic lights or in congested traffic. Illegal. When the engine is running and you are in control of the car, it is illegal to touch your phone. Now if you were a passenger in a car would you want the driver to be using their phone while driving? No so think when you're driving and you have the urge to look at your phone think of what could happen if you take your eyes of the road or how you would feel if someone on their phone while driving. Please don't text while drive or get on your phone.\\n\\nSo now should people should you use your phone while driving? Think of what could happen while doing such a thing like checking your phone. It isn't worth it at all to look at that notification at all. You can save yourself from getting into an accident. You can save yourself from potentially killing someone for just looking away for 2 seconds. So please don't use your phone while driving please and thank you.\\n\\nCities: Phones & Driving\\n\\n1. https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html\\n\\n2. https://www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html\\n\\n3. https://www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html\\n\\n4. https://www. safewise. com/faq/auto-safety/danger-texting-driving/\\n\\n5. https://www. drivinglaws. org/indexhf. php\\n\\n6. https://www. pantagraph. com/news/opinion/mailbag/texting-while-driving-puts-others-at-risk/article_403288a0-b77c-11de-9bf8-001cc4c002e0. html   \", 'Phone and driving\\n\\nAccording to, \"Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts\" show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers.

The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.\\n\\nAfter the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.\\n\\nSeagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.\\n\\nMy conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can \"open someones eyes\" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, \"It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.\" Seagoing Cowboys are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, he almost fell off because he was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked his ribs on the ship, he didn\\'t quit, he kept being a Seagoing Cowboy, and continued to help the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys care more about the animals than they do themselves, and that is great. Because it might be hard work but the animals need all the help they can get.', \"I believe you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you will get to go so many places. Have you ever wanted to go to the Acropolis in Greece? If you join the the Seagoing Cowboys program then you might do just that. Luke a real Seagoing Cowboy has also visited an excavated castle in Crete. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you'll get to go there and many more places.\\n\\nAnother reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys is you will get to help people. You'll get to have that warm feeling inside basically all the time. You'll also get to take care of animals aboard a ship. You'll get to work with animals like horses, young cows, and mules. Luke got to do just that and had the best time as a Seagoing Cowboy.\\n\\nMy last reason of why I believe you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it will open up the world up to you. You'll go many places and when thats done you will do many different activities! You will get to do boxing, table tennis, and fencing. If you dont like active activities then you can read or take up whittling. Luke got to do all of this and had the best time there. This is why I believe you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.   \", 'Hello, my name is Luke Bomberger and I am in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Here in the Seagoing Cowboys program you are able to help people, travel the world, and also have fun a long the way. Now I will tell you about the experiences I have had as a Seagoing Cowboy and why you should join.\\n\\nFirst I am going to tell you why I became a Seagoing Cowboy. When I graduated high school I had no idea what to do. Until my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn\\'t say no. I knew it was an opportunity of a life time. Then I started my journey.\\n\\nIt was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. These countries needed food supplies, animals, and more to recover. Thats when 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA was an administration that hired \"Seagoing Cowboys\" to take care of animals that were shipped overseas. Thats when Don and I signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys.\\n\\nAfter the Pacific War ended in August, 1945. We received orders to report to New Orleans. The orders were to ship a corgo of 335 horses, plus enough hay and oats to feed them to Greece. The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.\\n\\nWhen you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to opportunity to travel to many different places. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and crossed the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War 2. I have also been to Europe and China. But seeing Greece was special to me.\\n\\nMost people think being a Seagoing Cowboy is all hard work and that we don\\'t have any fun. The people who say that are very wrong, Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of fun on their spare time. When we finish our orders we take some time off and do fun activites. In Venice, Italy, I took a gondala ride over a city with streets of water. In China I also toured an excavated castle, and marveled at the Panama Canal. Another way we have fun is on board. When the ships have been unloaded we play baseball games, vollyball games, fenceing, boxing, and many other fun things to help pass time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help people in need, travel the world, and have fun a long the way. Being a Seagoing Cowboy has been much more than an adventure for me, Luke Bomberger. It has opened up the world to me.
