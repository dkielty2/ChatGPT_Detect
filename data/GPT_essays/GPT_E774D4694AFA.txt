When we face a difficult decision, seeking advice from others is crucial. People around us have unique experiences and knowledge that we can learn from. They can provide insights that we might have overlooked, helping us view the situation from a different angle. By tapping into the wisdom of others, we minimize the risk of making hasty decisions or overlooking important factors.
