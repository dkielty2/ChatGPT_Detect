School is an important part of our lives. We spend a big chunk of our day there, learning new things and engaging in activities. One common activity that many students enjoy is sports. Sports are an average activity that many schools encourage their students to participate in.

Playing sports is a good way to stay active and healthy. It helps in maintaining a fit body and releases stress. By playing a sport, students get to exercise without even realizing it. It's a win-win situation!

However, there is one school policy that I don't agree with. Some schools have a policy that requires all students to participate in at least one sport. While this may sound like a good idea, it can be bad for students who are not interested in sports. Forcing someone to do something they don't enjoy can be demotivating and can even make them dislike the activity even more.

I believe that instead of making sports mandatory, schools should offer a variety of different activities for students to choose from. This way, everyone can find something they enjoy and can participate in it willingly. It could be music, art, drama, or even community service. By offering a range of activities, schools can cater to the different interests and talents of their students.

In conclusion, sports are a good activity for staying active and healthy. However, the school policy of making sports mandatory can be bad for students who are not interested in them. Offering a variety of activities is a better approach as it allows students to choose an activity they enjoy and are passionate about. After all, school is not just about academics, it's also about discovering ourselves and exploring our interests.
