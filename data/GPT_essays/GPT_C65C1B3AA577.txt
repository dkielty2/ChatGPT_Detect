The Unfair Electoral College System

The electoral college is an old system used in the election process of the United States. It is meant to determine the winner of the presidential election, but many people believe that it is an unfair system. The main reason for this belief is that it undermines the value of each individual vote.

In the electoral college system, each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. This means that some states have more electoral votes than others, even if they have a smaller population. For example, Wyoming, with its small population, has 3 electoral votes, while California, with its large population, has 55 electoral votes. This creates an imbalance, as the votes of people in smaller states have more weight than the votes of people in larger states.

Furthermore, the electoral college system does not take into account the popular vote. In the 2016 election, for instance, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election due to the electoral college system. This quote from Thomas Jefferson summarizes the frustration many people feel about this system: "The greatest danger could be that the president will not be the man most esteemed by the whole nation but the man better able to marshal enough supporters in a sufficient number of states."

This system of electing a president feels outdated and unfair. It fails to represent the will of the majority of people. Each person's vote should have the same value, regardless of the state they live in. In a true democracy, the popular vote should determine the outcome of the election.

There have been numerous calls for reforming the electoral college system. Some suggest eliminating it altogether and adopting a popular vote system. This would ensure that every vote counts, regardless of where someone lives. Others propose a proportional allocation of electoral votes, which would better reflect the popular vote within each state.

In conclusion, the electoral college system is an unfair system that undermines the value of each individual vote. It creates an imbalance in representation and fails to reflect the will of the majority of people. It is time to reconsider and reform this outdated electoral process, in order to create a more equitable and reflective system for future elections. As the youth of this nation, it is important for us to speak up and demand change for a more fair and just electoral system.
