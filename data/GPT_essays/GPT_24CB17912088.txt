The Electoral Collage and Unfair Voting Systems

In the United States, the electoral system is essential in determining who becomes the president. However, many citizens believe that this system is unfair and needs to be changed. The Electoral College, as it is commonly known, has been a subject of criticism because it does not always accurately reflect the will of the people.

To understand the electoral system, we should first understand the concept of voting. Voting is when citizens cast their ballots to choose their leaders. It is a fundamental right that every citizen should exercise. When it comes to electing the president, voting plays a crucial role. However, the electoral system sometimes fails to uphold the principle of "one person, one vote." This is where the Electoral College steps in.

The Electoral College is a group of people selected by each state who officially cast the votes for the president. Each state has a different number of electoral votes, depending on its population size. The candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes becomes the president.

One of the major issues with the Electoral College is that it can allow a candidate to become president even if they do not win the popular vote. This means that a candidate can receive fewer votes from citizens overall but still win the presidency due to the distribution of electoral votes. Many people find this aspect of the electoral system to be unfair.

As a citizen, it can be frustrating to feel like your vote does not count. It is like a camel carrying a load of votes, but some of those votes are seen as less important than others. This can lead to a sense of voter apathy, where citizens may feel discouraged and disengaged from the electoral process.

To address this issue, some people argue for a direct popular vote system, where the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide becomes the president. They believe that this would make the electoral process more fair and would truly reflect the will of the people.

However, changing the electoral system is not an easy task. It would require a constitutional amendment, which is a lengthy and challenging process. Some argue that the Electoral College is necessary to ensure that smaller states have a voice in the election. They believe that without the Electoral College, candidates would only focus on larger states with higher population densities.

In conclusion, the electoral system in the United States has its flaws. The Electoral College, though designed to ensure fair representation, can sometimes result in unfair outcomes. While some people advocate for a direct popular vote system, others argue that the Electoral College has its merits. As citizens, it is crucial to engage in conversations about our voting system and work towards a solution that benefits all citizens, making every vote truly count.
