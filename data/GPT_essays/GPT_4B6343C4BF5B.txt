The Electoral College: How I Feel About the Way We Vote for the President

The process of electing a president in the United States is a fascinating one, known as the Electoral College. This system involves each state being assigned a certain number of electors based on its population. These electors then cast their votes to determine the president. As a 6th-12th grader, I have mixed feelings about this way of voting.

On one hand, the Electoral College ensures that every state has a voice in the election. Each state, regardless of its size or population, has at least three electors representing it. This means that even states with smaller populations like Wyoming or Vermont have a say in the presidential race. Without the Electoral College, candidates might focus solely on highly populated states, neglecting the concerns of those in smaller states.

However, on the other hand, the Electoral College can lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not become president. This has happened in a few elections, including the most recent one in 2016. Some argue that this undermines the principle of democracy, as the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide does not necessarily win the presidency. This could make people feel like their votes don't really count, which can be disheartening.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives power to a select group of electors who ultimately decide the president. While these electors are supposed to represent the will of the people, they are not legally bound to vote according to the popular vote of their state. This means that in some cases, an elector could go against the will of the people and cast their vote for a different candidate. This aspect of the Electoral College can feel undemocratic and unfair to some.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a complex system that has its pros and cons. On one hand, it ensures that each state has a voice in the election, regardless of its population size. On the other hand, it can lead to situations where the popular vote winner doesn't become president, making some feel disenfranchised. Additionally, the power given to electors can be seen as undemocratic. As a young student, I believe it is important for our country to continually evaluate and discuss the way we choose our president, as our voices and votes matter greatly in shaping our future.
