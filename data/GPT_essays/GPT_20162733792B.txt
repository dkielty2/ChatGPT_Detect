Technology in the classroom allows students to actively participate and engage in their learning experience. With the help of computers, students can collaborate and share ideas, leading to a more vibrant classroom atmosphere.

Facial muscles are crucial in conveying and decoding emotions. In a technology-rich classroom, facial expressions provide valuable insights into students' reactions to various learning experiences.

Technology can also provide various tools, such as adaptive educational software or virtual simulations, that adapt to individual students' needs, enhancing their emotional connection to the learning experience.
