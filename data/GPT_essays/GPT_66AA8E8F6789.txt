Phones in School: A Student's Perspective

Phones have become an integral part of our lives, and for students, the debate about their presence in school is ongoing. As a student myself, I believe that phones can be a valuable tool for both learning and extracurricular activities, but with certain restrictions in place.

During school hours, phones can be used for educational purposes. For example, many of us take pictures of the whiteboard to refer back to it later when studying at home. Additionally, educational apps and online resources can enhance our learning experience. Whether it's downloading a dictionary app or accessing online textbooks, phones can be a convenient way to access information quickly.

However, the principal should set guidelines to ensure that phones are not a constant distraction. One way to achieve this is by implementing specific times where phone usage is allowed, such as during breaks or designated free periods. By doing so, students can still use their phones for school-related activities without disrupting the classroom environment.

Moreover, participating in extracurricular activities is an essential aspect of a student's life. Clubs and organizations often rely on phone communication to organize events and share important information. If students were not allowed to use their phones, it would be difficult to coordinate activities efficiently. For instance, a debate club may need to quickly inform members about a change in meeting time or location. In such cases, having a phone readily available would ensure that students remain informed and engaged in their chosen activities.

While phones can provide numerous benefits, it is crucial that we do not let them consume all of our time. Students should remember that school is primarily for academic learning, and excessive phone usage can hinder their educational progress. Instead of constantly being on their phones, students should find a balance between phone usage and focusing on their studies.

In conclusion, phones can be advantageous for students in school if used responsibly and within the guidelines set by the principal. By allowing students to use their phones during specific times for educational purposes and extracurricular activities, we can harness the potential of this technology while also prioritizing our academic responsibilities. As students, we should exercise self-control and use our phones as a tool rather than a constant source of distraction. With these measures in place, phones can enhance our school experience and help us become well-rounded individuals.
