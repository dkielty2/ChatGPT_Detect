As a student in the 6th to 12th grade, there are plenty of activities in school that I would like to talk about. School is an important part of our lives, and it is the place where we spend a significant amount of our time. Sometimes, I wish I could change a few things about it to make it even better for students like me.

One of the first things I would change is how grades are calculated. Currently, grades are based on tests, quizzes, and assignments. I believe that this system only measures a student's ability to memorize information and regurgitate it on a test. Instead, grades should also take into account other factors like class participation, real-world application, and creativity. This would provide a more well-rounded evaluation and give students the opportunity to showcase their skills beyond just academics.

Another change I would make is to introduce more activities and opportunities for students. While there are some extracurricular activities available, they are often limited and not accessible to everyone. I believe that schools should offer a wider variety of activities such as sports, clubs, and arts programs. This would allow students to explore their interests and passions outside of the regular curriculum.

The school environment itself could also benefit from some changes. For example, I would love to see a more interactive and engaging learning environment. Instead of just sitting at desks and listening to lectures, students should have more hands-on experiences and collaborative projects. This would make learning more enjoyable and memorable.

Furthermore, the role of the principal is crucial in implementing these changes. The principal should be open to new ideas and actively seek feedback from students. They should listen to our suggestions and work with the teachers and staff to create a school environment that promotes student growth and success. The principal should also ensure that students feel safe and supported in the school community.

Overall, making these changes would improve the school experience for students. It would allow us to showcase our abilities beyond just our grades, provide more opportunities for growth and exploration, and create a more engaging learning environment. By actively involving the principal and seeking student input, we can work towards a school that is truly student-centered. I believe that these changes would lead to higher student satisfaction and an increase in the average performance of students as they would actually be motivated to learn and participate in school activities.
