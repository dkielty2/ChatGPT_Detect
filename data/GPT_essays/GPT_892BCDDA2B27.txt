The Electoral Collage: The Unfair Process of Choosing our President

The concept of electing our nation's president through the Electoral College has long been a subject of debate and controversy. As a young citizen who believes in the power of democracy, I find it unfair that our votes can be undermined by this outdated system. It is disheartening to think that even though our votes matter, they are not the sole determinant of who becomes the president.

The Electoral College is a process used to elect the president of the United States. It consists of a group of representatives, known as electors, who are chosen by each state to vote for the president on behalf of the people. Each state is assigned a certain number of electors based on its population, ensuring that smaller states have some influence in the election. However, this system poses various problems that outweigh its intent.

One major issue is the lack of direct representation. In a true democracy, the president should be elected by the people, where each person's vote carries the same weight. However, with the Electoral College, the fate of our national leadership lies in the hands of a few select electors. This leaves the majority of voters feeling voiceless and disregarded in the electoral process.

Moreover, the Electoral College undermines the principle of "one person, one vote." Instead of a popular vote deciding the presidency, the winner is determined by the number of electors a candidate receives. This creates a situation where a candidate can win the presidency without securing the majority of the popular vote. This has happened multiple times throughout history, making many question the fairness and legitimacy of our electoral system.

As a young citizen, I believe that the president should represent the will of the people. The Electoral College fails to achieve this, as it often results in the president being elected by a minority of voters. It is disheartening to think that my father, who works hard and participates in our democracy, may have his vote overshadowed by this flawed process.

In an era where information is readily available, the Electoral College seems outdated. The world has changed since its inception, and it no longer serves as an effective source of democratic representation. We need a modern system that accurately reflects the will of the people and ensures that every vote counts equally.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an unfair process that undermines the democratic values on which our great nation was founded. The idea that our votes can be overridden by a select group of electors is disconcerting. As young citizens, it is crucial that we advocate for positive change in our electoral system, ensuring that the popular vote becomes the primary source of electing our president. It is time for us to embrace a more inclusive and equitable electoral process that truly reflects the will of the people.
