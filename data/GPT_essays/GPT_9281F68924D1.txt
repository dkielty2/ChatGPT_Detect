My School Activities

School is important for children as it helps us grow and learn new things. As a 6th to 12th-grade student, I have experienced various activities that would make my time at school more enjoyable and meaningful. However, there are some activities that may have a bad impact and make school less enjoyable. In this essay, I will discuss the activities that I think would be beneficial for students and those that I consider allowing in school.

Firstly, I would like to mention the extracurricular activities that make school more fun. Sports, for instance, provide an opportunity to stay active and develop teamwork skills. Participating in these activities helps students maintain a healthy lifestyle and improve their physical fitness. Moreover, it allows us to make new friends and broaden our social circles, which is always a positive aspect of school life.

Another activity that I believe would benefit students is artistic expression. Allowing students to engage in activities such as painting, drawing, or playing instruments can enhance our creativity. Art is a form of self-expression, and it teaches us to think outside the box. Moreover, it allows us to showcase our talents and build self-confidence. In short, incorporating art programs into our school curriculum would be wonderful.

On the other hand, there are certain activities that I think would make school bad and negatively impact students. One such example is too much homework. While homework is necessary to reinforce what we learn in class, excessive amounts can be overwhelming and cause unnecessary stress. It is important to strike a balance between schoolwork and personal time, ensuring that students have enough time to rest and pursue other interests.

Furthermore, I would like to address the issue of social media and electronic devices in school. While technology has its benefits, allowing unlimited use of electronic devices can be detrimental to a child's education. It is essential to implement guidelines and restrictions to ensure that students do not get distracted or addicted to their devices during school hours.

In conclusion, there are various activities that I would want to see implemented in my school, as well as some that I think would have a negative impact. Extracurricular activities like sports and art would be great additions to make school more enjoyable and beneficial for students. On the other hand, enforcing too much homework and allowing unlimited electronic device usage can make school bad and hinder our learning experience. Finding a balance and considering the well-being of students is crucial when allowing certain activities in school.
