The Electoral College: A Collage of Unfairness

The electoral college is a system of voting that many people don't like because they believe it is unfair. In this essay, I will explain why some voters don't want this system to exist.

Firstly, the electoral college can be confusing and complicated for many young people who are just starting to understand the importance of voting. It's like trying to put together a collage without knowing where all the pieces go. This can discourage new voters from participating in the electoral process because they may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the system.

Moreover, some feel that the electoral college takes away from the value of an individual voter's voice. Every person's vote should count equally, but the electoral college doesn't always reflect this principle. Instead, it gives more power to certain states, making it seem unfair to voters in states with smaller populations. It's like having a contest where some participants are given more chances to win than others – that's just not right!

Another issue with the electoral college is that it doesn't always represent the will of the people. There have been several instances where the winner of the popular vote did not become president because of how the electoral college works. This makes some voters feel like their votes don't truly matter, as they are overruled by this system. It's as if the rules of the game are changed in the middle, which can be frustrating and discouraging.

Additionally, the electoral college can also be seen as unfair because it encourages candidates to focus mainly on swing states rather than the needs of the entire country. This means that some areas and groups of people may be left without proper representation in the election process. It's like having a group project and only a few students getting attention while the rest are ignored – that's not fair at all!

In conclusion, the electoral college is a collage of unfairness that many voters don't like or want. People feel that it is complicated, takes away their individual vote's value, doesn't always represent the will of the people, and encourages candidates to focus on swing states. As we evolve as a society, it is important to reevaluate systems like this and strive for fairness and equality in our electoral process.
