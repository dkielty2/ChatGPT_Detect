The cowboys not only witness this incredible sight but also take part in making a positive difference.

Taking care of the animals is no easy task, but the seagoing cowboys have it covered. They make sure the animals are well-fed, hydrated, and comfortable. The cowboys work closely with veterinarians, learning how to handle any emergencies that may arise during the journey. It's a great responsibility, but with hard work and dedication, they are able to provide top-notch care for their animal companions.

One of the most exciting parts of being a seagoing cowboy is the adventures they get to experience firsthand.
