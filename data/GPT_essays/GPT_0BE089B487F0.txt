Secondly, driverless cars offer numerous benefits, such as increased accessibility for individuals with disabilities or the elderly. These individuals can regain their independence by utilizing self-driving vehicles, allowing them to travel more freely and conveniently. Additionally, ride-sharing services using driveless cars could become more affordable and accessible, making transportation more equitable for everyone.

Furthermore, individuals who spend long hours commuting can benefit tremendously from driveless cars. Instead of being stuck behind the wheel, they can use this time for productive activities, such as work, reading, or relaxing. This increased productivity could have a positive impact on people's work-life balance and overall well-being.

Some may argue that the concept of driverless cars is useless and unnecessary. They might feel hesitant to embrace this change due to concerns about job loss for professional drivers.
