Title: The Power of the People: Changing the Way We Vote

Introduction (50 words):
Voting is a fundamental right that allows the people to choose their leaders and shape the destiny of their country. Every citizen's vote has the power to change the course of the nation and determine who becomes the president. However, in today's changing world, the way we vote and the rules surrounding elections should be reconsidered to make them more inclusive and representative of the people's will.

Body Paragraph 1: The Need for New Voting Methods (90 words):
As our country and its diverse population continue to grow, our voting system needs to evolve too. One way to ensure fairness and accuracy is by adopting new voting methods. For example, implementing ranked-choice voting would allow citizens to vote for multiple candidates in order of preference. This would make elections less about winning a majority and more about catering to the diverse opinions and needs of the people.

Body Paragraph 2: Increasing Voter Turnout (90 words):
To make voting a more impactful process, steps must be taken to ensure maximum participation. It is disheartening to see a low voter turnout when the decisions made by the elected president affect the entire country. To address this issue, accessible voting methods, such as online or mail-in voting, could be introduced. By making it easier and more convenient for people to vote, we would witness a higher level of democratic engagement.

Body Paragraph 3: Fair Representation (90 words):
The rule of "one person, one vote" should remain at the heart of our electoral system. However, gerrymandering, the practice of redrawing electoral district boundaries for political advantage, undermines that principle. By removing gerrymandering from the equation, we can guarantee fair representation for all citizens. This would enable us to build a government that truly reflects the diversity of our communities and respects the power of individual votes.

Conclusion (50 words):
As young citizens of a changing country, we must advocate for improvements in the way we vote to ensure our voices are heard. By adopting new voting methods, increasing voter turnout, and maintaining fair representation, we can establish a stronger democracy. Remember, every vote counts, and together, we can shape the future of our great nation.
