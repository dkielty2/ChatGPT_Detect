Title: The Electoral College: An Ancient Anachronism in Our Voting System

Introduction:
The Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our electoral system in the United States. It was established to ensure that each state has a say in electing the President. However, as a 6-12-grade student, I believe that the Electoral College should be reconsidered and replaced with a more modern and fair approach to electing our nation's leader.

Main Body:
The Electoral College, composed of electors from each state, determines the President based on the popular vote within each state. Each state gets a certain number of electors, which is equal to the number of senators and representatives it has. The person who secures the majority of electoral votes becomes the President.

While the Electoral College was implemented at a time when direct, nationwide voting was not feasible, it has become an anachronism in our modern society. In today's interconnected world, people are better informed and have access to various sources of information to make informed decisions.

The popular vote should be the deciding factor in choosing our President. It is an essential aspect of democracy, as it ensures that every eligible voter's voice counts. The current system, however, allows for the possibility that a candidate may win the popular vote but still lose the electoral vote. This undermines the very principle of democracy that our nation was built upon.

Furthermore, the Electoral College often results in swing states, states that can determine the outcome of an election, receiving a disproportionate amount of attention from candidates during campaigns. This system can lead to candidates neglecting the concerns and issues of citizens in non-swing states. Every state and every person's vote should be equally valued and considered.

Therefore, it would be fairer to elect the President through a national popular vote. This would ensure that each citizen's vote carries equal weight, regardless of the state they reside in. A person must secure the majority of the overall popular vote to become the President, which aligns with the fundamental principles of democracy.

Conclusion:
As a student who understands the importance of democracy, I believe it is time to reassess the Electoral College system. While it served its purpose in the past, it has become an outdated and unfair method for electing our nation's leader. The popular vote should be the primary determining factor in electing the President, ensuring that every citizen's voice is heard and valued. It is time for our voting system to evolve and adapt to the needs of the modern world.
