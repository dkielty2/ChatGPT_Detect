1. Discovering Passions and Interests:
Participating in school activities allows us to explore various hobbies and interests that we may have never discovered otherwise. It provides us with an opportunity to try new things and helps us understand what brings us joy and fulfillment. Whether it's joining the school band, drama club, or sports teams, engaging in different activities expose us to new experiences and helps us identify our passions.
