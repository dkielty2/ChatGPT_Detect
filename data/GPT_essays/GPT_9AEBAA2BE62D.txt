The Electoral Vote: Outdated and Unfair

The Electoral Vote has been the way we choose our representatives for centuries. However, many people believe that it is an outdated and unfair system. The reason for this belief is that it does not accurately represent the will of the people and can result in the election of a candidate who did not receive the majority of the popular vote.

In the United States, when we vote in a presidential election, we do not directly vote for the candidate of our choice. Instead, we vote for a group of electors who then cast their votes for the candidate who won in their state. This means that the candidate who receives the most Electoral Votes, rather than the most individual votes, becomes the president.

This way of choosing our leaders is outdated because it was established in a time when communication and travel were much more difficult. Back then, it made sense to have a group of representatives who could travel to the capital to cast their votes on behalf of the people. However, with advancements in technology and the ease of communication, there is no longer a need for this indirect voting method.

Furthermore, the Electoral Vote can be seen as unfair because it gives more power to smaller states. Since each state is given a certain number of electoral votes based on their representation in Congress, this means that less-populated states have a disproportionate influence on the outcome of the election. This can result in a situation where the candidate who received the majority of the popular vote nationwide does not become president.

For example, let's say Candidate A wins the popular vote in State X by a small margin and receives all of its electoral votes. Meanwhile, Candidate B wins the popular vote in State Y by a large margin but only receives a small number of electoral votes. In this scenario, Candidate A, who did not receive the majority of the popular vote, would become president simply because they won more states. This can feel incredibly unfair to those who voted for Candidate B.

In conclusion, the Electoral Vote system is outdated and unfair. It does not accurately represent the will of the people and can result in the election of a candidate who did not receive the majority of the popular vote. In a modern society, it is time to reconsider this voting method and embrace a more democratic approach that truly reflects the voice of the people.
