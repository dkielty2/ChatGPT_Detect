The Electoral College: Should We Get Rid of It?

The process of electing our president is a topic that has been discussed among many people in our state and throughout the country. One way our president is elected is through the Electoral College. However, there are those who believe it is time to get rid of this system. In this essay, I will discuss why some people think we should abolish the Electoral College.

One of the main reasons people argue for the elimination of the Electoral College is because they believe it undermines the power of the people's vote. Each state has a certain number of electors based on their population, and these electors are the ones who actually choose the president. This means that even if a candidate wins the popular vote in a state, they may not necessarily receive all of that state's electors. This has led to instances where the candidate who received the majority of the popular vote did not become the president, which many people find unfair.

Another reason people believe we should get rid of the Electoral College is because it gives certain states more influence than others. Each state has a minimum of three electors, regardless of their population. This means that less populous states have a greater per capita influence on the outcome of the election. Some argue that this is not a fair representation of the will of the people and that every vote should have equal weight, regardless of the state they live in.

Moreover, critics of the Electoral College think it is archaic and outdated. They argue that we live in a modern society where technology allows for easier communication and direct democracy. With the advent of the internet and social media, people now have the ability to express their views and influence the outcome of elections like never before. Therefore, some people believe that the Electoral College is no longer necessary in our increasingly connected world.

In conclusion, there are valid reasons why some people believe we should get rid of the Electoral College. They argue that it undermines the power of the people's vote, gives certain states more influence, and is outdated in today's digital age. While the Electoral College was created for a reason, it may be time to reconsider whether it is still the best system for electing our president. Ultimately, whether to keep or abolish the Electoral College is a decision that should be carefully considered to ensure the voice of every citizen is heard in our democratic society.
