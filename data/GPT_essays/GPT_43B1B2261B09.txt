The Electoral College: A Vote Ignored by the State

The electoral system of voting for the President through the Electoral College is a topic that sparks much debate and controversy. In this essay, we will discuss how the electoral vote can sometimes be ignored by the state, leaving us wondering if it truly represents the will of the population.

The Electoral College is made up of electors from each state, who are chosen based on the state's population. Each state has a specific number of electors, which is determined by the total number of representatives and senators it has in Congress. These electors then cast their votes for the President, based on the popular vote of their respective states.

However, there have been instances where the state's electoral vote does not accurately reflect the will of the people. This occurs when a candidate, despite winning the popular vote, does not receive enough electoral votes to become the President. This issue was seen in the 2016 election, where Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but Donald Trump won the electoral vote and ultimately became the President.

This discrepancy arises from the winner-takes-all approach that most states adopt when allocating their electoral votes. This means that the candidate who gets the majority of the popular vote in a state receives all of its electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. This system can sometimes lead to the candidate who wins the popular vote losing the election, as seen in the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush.

Critics argue that this system gives more weight to smaller states, as they have a higher ratio of electors to population. This means that the votes of individuals in smaller states hold more power compared to those in larger states. For example, Wyoming, with its low population, has only three electoral votes while California, with its large population, has fifty-five. This discrepancy undermines the principle of "one person, one vote."

Furthermore, the Electoral College system can sometimes result in candidates ignoring the interests of states with low electoral votes, as it does not align with their goal of winning the majority of electoral votes. Candidates tend to focus their campaigns on states with a higher number of electoral votes, such as Florida or Pennsylvania, leaving smaller states with less influence on the election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College can be seen as a vote ignored by the state as it sometimes fails to accurately represent the will of the population. The winner-takes-all approach and the discrepancies in the allocation of electoral votes give smaller states more power, undermining the principle of equal representation. There is a growing debate about whether the Electoral College should be reformed or abolished, in order to ensure that every vote counts and that the President truly reflects the will of the people.
