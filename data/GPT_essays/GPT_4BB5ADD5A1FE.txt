The Electoral College: Why We Need to Rethink the Way We Elect Our President

In the United States, the presidential election process revolves around the Electoral College. This system, while once necessary, is now outdated and in need of an overhaul. As young citizens, we should question the effectiveness of this institution and advocate for a more direct method of electing our leaders.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the president directly by the people and having him elected by Congress. The idea was to create a more balanced and fair way of electing the chief executive. However, in today's society, this method seems to be anything but fair.

One issue with the Electoral College is that it allows for the possibility of a president being elected without winning the popular vote. This has happened five times in our history, most recently in the 2016 election. This is a clear example of the Electoral College failing to accurately represent the will of the people.

Another problem with the Electoral College is that it gives disproportionate power to small states. With a winner-takes-all system in most states, a candidate who wins the popular vote in a small state can receive all of that state's electoral votes. This means that a handful of voters in sparsely populated states have a larger say in the outcome of the election than the majority of voters in more populous states. This goes against the principle of "one person, one vote" that we hold dear in a democracy.

Furthermore, the process of selecting electors within each state is often overlooked. These electors are not required to vote in accordance with the popular vote of their state, leading to the potential for them to choose a president against the will of the people. This undermines the basic principle of democracy, where the power lies in the hands of the citizens.

It is time to reevaluate the Electoral College and consider a more direct and equal method of electing our president. A system where the candidate who wins the most votes across the country becomes the president would ensure a true representation of the people's will. This would also eliminate the outdated concept of electors, who often go against the popular vote.

In conclusion, as young citizens, we must recognize that the Electoral College is an outdated and flawed system. The presidential election process should reflect the values of democracy and ensure that every vote counts equally. It is time to reevaluate this system and strive for a more direct method of electing our leaders. Let us advocate for change and work towards a more fair and representative electoral process.
