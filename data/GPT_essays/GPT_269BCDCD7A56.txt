Title: The Importance of Student Participation in School Activities

Introduction (approx. 70 words):
Participating in activities is an essential part of being a student in school. It provides an opportunity for students to showcase their talents, develop new skills, and form strong bonds with their peers. In this essay, we will discuss how students benefit from being involved in school activities, particularly sports, and the importance of having a policy that allows every student to participate, regardless of their academic average or grade level.

Body Paragraph 1 - Benefits of Student Participation (approx. 100 words):
Engaging in school activities benefits students in various ways. First and foremost, such activities allow students to explore their interests and cultivate their talents beyond the classroom setting. For instance, participating in a sport helps students stay physically active, enhancing their overall well-being. Moreover, joining extracurricular activities gives students opportunities to develop essential life skills like teamwork, leadership, and time management, which are equally important for success in school and future endeavors.

Body Paragraph 2 - Equal Participation for All (approx. 130 words):
To ensure all students can participate in activities, regardless of their academic average or grade, a fair policy must be implemented. The current grading system often creates barriers for students with lower grades, limiting their involvement in activities they are passionate about. By introducing a policy that allows every student to participate, the school can promote inclusivity and encourage overall student well-being.

Body Paragraph 3 - Sports as an Inclusive Activity (approx. 130 words):
Sports play a crucial role in fostering inclusivity. They provide an avenue for students to engage in physical activity, promoting a healthy and active lifestyle. However, the exclusivity and selectiveness often associated with school sports teams prevent many students from participating. Change in policy that emphasizes inclusion based on interest rather than skill level would enable all students to try out for teams, promoting a sense of belonging and school spirit. Students who may not excel academically are often driven by their passion for sports and can greatly benefit from being able to participate.

Conclusion (approx. 90 words):
Participation in school activities is vital for the holistic development of students. Extracurricular activities and sports provide opportunities to showcase talents, learn valuable skills, and foster a sense of belonging. Implementing a policy that allows all students, regardless of their academic average or grade, to participate in activities will promote inclusivity, maximizine student engagement, and contribute to a positive school environment. By providing equitable opportunities for involvement, schools can nurture well-rounded, confident individuals prepared for future success.
