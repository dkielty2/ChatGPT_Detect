1. Always be yourself:
The most important piece of advice when it comes to making friends is to always be yourself. Pretending to be someone you're not will only create friendships based on false pretenses. Genuine connections are built when others appreciate you for who you truly are.

2. Make the first move:
Sometimes you have to muster up some courage and make the first move. Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation or invite someone to join in an activity. Remember that the other person might be feeling just as nervous as you are, so taking that first step is crucial.

3. Right friends for you:
When making friends, choose those who bring out the best in you and share similar interests and values. Spending time with people who have a positive influence on your life will ensure a healthier and more fulfilling friendship.

4. Ask and listen:
Showing genuine interest in others is a great way to make friends. Ask questions and actively listen to their responses. This demonstrates that you care about their thoughts and feelings, strengthening the bond between you.

5. Ever be kind:
Kindness goes a long way in forming and maintaining friendships. Treat others with respect, offer a helping hand, and celebrate their successes. When you show kindness, you create a positive environment that friends will want to be a part of.

6. Think before you speak:
Words can have a profound impact, so it's important to think before you speak. Avoid saying things that may hurt others' feelings or spread negativity. Take a moment to consider the impact your words could have and choose them wisely.

7. Make sure to nurture your friendships:
Friendships require effort and nurturing. Make time for your friends, engage in activities together, and offer support during both good and challenging times. Regularly reaching out and showing that you care will help maintain strong and lasting friendships.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, making and keeping friends is an essential part of our lives.

Remember, always be kind, think before speaking, and ensure you consistently nurture your friendships.
