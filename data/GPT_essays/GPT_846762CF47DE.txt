The Electoral College: A System for Change

When it comes to electing the president of our great nation, the Electoral College is a system that must undergo some changes. This system, which was designed by our founding fathers, has its benefits, but it also has some drawbacks that need to be addressed. Let's dive into the world of electoral voting, the role it plays in our election system, and why reform is necessary.

The Electoral College is a unique process in which the president is chosen indirectly. Each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a particular state receives all of its electoral votes. This system ensures that no one state can dominate the presidency and that smaller states have some say in the outcome.

However, this system is not without flaws. One major issue is the possibility of a president winning the popular vote but losing the election. This happened as recently as the 2016 election, where the candidate who received the most votes nationwide did not become president. This discrepancy can be disheartening for voters who believe their vote matters and undermines the democratic principles our nation was founded upon.

Another concern is that the Electoral College can sometimes lead to "swing states" receiving more attention than others. Candidates often focus their campaigns on states that are known to be competitive, neglecting states that are either solidly Republican or Democrat. This can give the impression that voters in these non-competitive states do not have a significant impact on the election outcome, potentially lowering voter turnout.

To address these issues, our electoral system must be reformed. One potential solution is the adoption of a national popular vote. Under this system, the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide would become president. This would ensure that every voter's voice is heard, regardless of which state they reside in. Additionally, it would eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election.

Another reform could be the proportional allocation of electoral votes. Rather than winner-takes-all, states could distribute their electoral votes based on the proportion of votes each candidate receives. This would enable smaller parties and candidates to have a chance of gaining electoral votes and would encourage voters to consider third-party options, promoting a more diverse political landscape.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College does have some advantages, it also presents significant challenges that need to be addressed. The current system can lead to certain states receiving disproportionate attention and can potentially undermine the popular vote. Reforms such as adopting a national popular vote or proportional allocation of electoral votes would ensure that our election system truly reflects the will of the people. As young citizens, we must advocate for change to create a fairer and more inclusive electoral process. The power to shape our democracy lies in our hands – let's make it count.
