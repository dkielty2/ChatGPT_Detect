The Electoral College: Giving the Power of the Vote to the People

One of the most important actions a citizen of the United States can take is to cast their vote, especially during the presidential election. However, many have questioned the effectiveness and fairness of the Electoral College system. Some individuals argue that the system can upset the wishes of the people and leave them feeling powerless to bring about change. In this essay, we will explore the role of the Electoral College at both the state and national level and discuss whether it should be reformed or abolished.

The Electoral College is a system by which the president of the United States is elected. Each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on their population. These votes are then cast by electors who are chosen by the political parties. The candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the president.

While the Electoral College was designed to balance power between states, it can sometimes make people feel like their vote does not matter. In the current system, if a candidate wins the popular vote in a state, they receive all of that state's electoral votes. This means that even if a candidate wins by a small margin, they receive all the electoral votes, leaving many voters feeling left out.

Another concern with the Electoral College is that it can lead to an upset in the overall outcome of the presidential election. This was evident in the 2016 election when the candidate who won the majority of the popular vote did not win the presidency. This upset many people who felt that their votes did not count and challenged the legitimacy of the system.

Some argue that the Electoral College should be abolished in favor of a popular vote system. They argue that this would ensure that every vote counts and the candidate who wins the majority of votes would become president. Others propose a reform that allocates electoral votes proportionally, giving a fairer representation of the people's will.

However, it is essential to consider the advantages of the Electoral College as well. The system ensures that smaller states have a say in the presidential election, preventing larger states from dominating the process. It also forces candidates to campaign in a wide range of states instead of focusing solely on densely populated areas.

To conclude, the Electoral College is a critical aspect of our democracy, although it raises valid concerns for some individuals. While it may not always reflect the popular vote, it serves to balance the power between states and give smaller states a voice. Nonetheless, it is important to have an ongoing discussion about potential reforms or alternatives to ensure that every person's vote is valued and contributes to the democratic process.
