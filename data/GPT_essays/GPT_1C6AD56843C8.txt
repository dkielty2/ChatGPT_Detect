Title: The Changes I Would Make to School Activities and Sports Policies

Introduction:
As a student, I believe that change is a crucial aspect of our lives. We are constantly evolving, learning, and adapting to new situations. In this essay, I will be discussing some changes that I would make to the activities and sports policies at our school. These changes are aimed at improving the student experience and fostering a more inclusive environment.

Body:

Firstly, I would propose a change in the grading policy. Currently, our school follows a traditional letter grading system. While it provides a measure of academic performance, it can often discourage students who may be working hard but struggling to achieve high grades. I believe that introducing a more comprehensive grading system that considers multiple aspects of a student's learning journey would be more beneficial. For instance, incorporating project-based assessments and engaging in-class participation evaluations can provide a more accurate representation of a student's abilities.

Moreover, I think it is important for our school to offer a diverse range of sports activities. While the conventional sports like basketball and soccer are popular, there are many students who may have interests in alternative sports such as table tennis or kickboxing. By expanding the sports options, more students would be encouraged to participate and engage in physical activities they genuinely enjoy. This inclusivity would promote a healthier and well-rounded student body.

Another change I would suggest is implementing an average grading system for sports. Currently, our grades are solely based on academic performance. However, recognizing achievements in sports can provide motivation for many students who excel in extracurricular activities. By taking into account a student's average grades across both academics and sports, we can truly reflect their overall performance and dedication.

Furthermore, I believe that giving students the opportunity to play a role in decision-making is essential. Establishing a student council where student representatives work together with teachers and administrators can provide a platform for our voices to be heard. By involving students in the decision-making process, we can ensure that our ideas and feedback are taken into consideration when implementing changes to school policies and activities.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, I believe that making the suggested changes to our school's activities and sports policies would greatly benefit the student body. Introducing a more comprehensive grading policy, providing a wider variety of sports options, recognizing achievements in sports, and involving students in decision-making are all steps toward fostering an inclusive and vibrant learning environment. Embracing change is essential for growth, and by implementing these changes, our school can truly thrive.
