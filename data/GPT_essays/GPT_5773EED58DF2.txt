The Electoral College: A Problematic Process in Our Country's Election

One of the most significant aspects of the election process in the United States is the Electoral College. Designed to ensure a fair representation of the states, it has become a problematic system that can cause issues in our country's election outcomes. The focus of this essay will revolve around the problems associated with the Electoral College and how it can lead to a disconnection between the popular vote and electing the President.

The Electoral College is a body of electors chosen by each state to cast votes for the President and Vice President. It consists of 538 electors, equal to the total number of senators and representatives in Congress. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on their representation in Congress. While the Electoral College was initially created to give smaller states a voice, it now poses several problems.

One significant issue with the Electoral College is the possibility of electing a President who did not win the popular vote. This has happened multiple times in our history, with the most recent occurrence in the 2016 election. In that election, the candidate who won the majority of the popular vote did not win the presidency. This can cause frustration among citizens who believe their vote does not truly count towards electing the President.

Furthermore, the winner-takes-all system adopted by most states in the Electoral College can lead to a skewed representation of the people's will. In this system, the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state receives all of the state's electoral votes. This means that even if a candidate wins a state by a small margin, they receive all the electors from that state. As a result, the voices of those who voted for the opposing candidate may feel ignored and unrepresented.

Another problem arises from the unequal weight assigned to votes in different states. Due to the distribution of electors, some states hold more influence in the outcome of the election compared to others. This can lead to candidates focusing their campaigns and policies towards these swing states, neglecting the concerns and needs of citizens in other states. This imbalance creates an unfair advantage for certain regions and undermines the principle of equal representation.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College was implemented with good intentions to offer a fair representation of states, it has become a problematic process that can cause disconnect between the popular vote and electing the President. The winner-takes-all system, the possibility of the popular vote winner not being elected, and the uneven weight of votes across states are all significant issues that need to be addressed. As we continue to shape our democracy, it is crucial to explore alternatives to the Electoral College that guarantee every citizen's vote counts and accurately reflects their choice for President.
