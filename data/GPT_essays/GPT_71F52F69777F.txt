The face on Mars is a landform that resembles a human face, and it was first captured by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976.

In 2001, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission captured new images of the face on Mars. These images revealed that the face was not as mysterious as it initially seemed.

Scientists believe that the face on Mars is merely an example of pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon where the human mind interprets random patterns or objects as familiar ones, such as a face. The combination of shadows and erosion created the face-like appearance that initially caught everyone's attention.

Despite this scientific explanation, some people still hold on to the idea that the face on Mars is evidence of intelligent alien life. This fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial beings has inspired countless books, movies, and conspiracy theories.
