The Electoral College: Fixing the Flawed Voting System

The electoral system in our country, commonly known as the Electoral College, has been a topic of debate for many years. As a 6th to 12th-grade student, I believe it is important to discuss this issue and explore ways to fix its flaws. Although the system was designed to ensure fair representation, it has some major drawbacks that need to be addressed.

One of the main issues with the Electoral College is that it can override the popular vote. This means that even if a candidate wins the majority of the individual votes, they might not win the presidency. This can lead to a lack of trust in the system, as the voice of the people is not directly reflected in the outcome.

To fix this flaw, one possible solution would be to eliminate the Electoral College altogether and solely rely on the popular vote. In this way, the candidate who receives the highest number of votes nationwide would become the president. This would ensure that every vote counts and accurately represents the choice of the people.

However, some disagree with the complete elimination of the Electoral College, arguing that it helps balance power between larger and smaller states. As an alternative, another way to fix the system would be to modify it by allocating electoral votes based on a proportional system. Currently, all states except for Maine and Nebraska follow the winner-takes-all principle, where the entire electoral votes of the state go to the candidate who wins the popular vote. If each state were to distribute their electoral votes proportionally, it would provide more fairness and accuracy in representing the will of the people.

Furthermore, there have been various proposals to reform the Electoral College by implementing a ranked-choice voting system. Under this system, voters would have the opportunity to rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives the majority of first-choice votes, the second-choice votes would be considered, and so on, until a candidate reaches the majority. This approach not only takes into account the popular vote but also encourages more participation and reduces the need for strategic voting.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an important component of our democracy. However, it is crucial to acknowledge its flaws and find ways to fix them. Whether it is by completely relying on the popular vote, adopting a proportional electoral system, or introducing ranked-choice voting, these alternatives would address the current shortcomings. By making voting more fair and reflective of the will of the people, we can strengthen our electoral system and ensure that everyone's voice truly matters.
