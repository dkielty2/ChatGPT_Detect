It provides us with an answer, helps us discover better solutions, offers multiple opinions, and allows us to benefit from others' expertise. By actively seeking advice, we develop a broader understanding of the issues we face and increase our chances of finding effective solutions. Therefore, it is in our best interest to embrace the guidance of others in our pursuit of personal and academic growth.
