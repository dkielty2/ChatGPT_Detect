The Electoral College: Is It Time for a Change?

The idea of voting and the electoral process can sometimes be confusing, especially for us in middle school. But it's important for us to understand how our president is chosen. Currently, the United States uses a system known as the Electoral College, and many people are debating whether this system should stay or if a new method should be put into place.

The Electoral College is a group of representatives who ultimately decide who will become our president. Each state is given a certain number of electors based on its population, and these electors cast their vote for the president based on the popular vote in their state. This means that even if a candidate wins the most votes overall (known as the popular vote), they might not win the presidency if they don't have enough electoral votes.

Now, some people argue that the Electoral College is a fair system because it gives smaller states a voice in the election. They believe it prevents candidates from only focusing on cities with large populations. However, others think that the popular vote should determine the president because it represents the will of the majority. They argue that every vote should count equally, regardless of where a person lives.

Personally, I believe that the popular vote should be the deciding factor in electing the president. It seems more democratic to me that the candidate with the most votes wins, rather than having a system where someone can win the presidency without winning the majority of votes.

Instead of the Electoral College, we could adopt a system known as the popular vote. This would mean that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide becomes the president. It would make voting simpler and fairer. Every vote would carry the same weight, and it would encourage more people to participate in elections, knowing that their vote truly matters.

Some might argue that the current system makes candidates focus on a variety of states instead of solely targeting high-population areas. However, with a popular vote system, candidates would need to appeal to the entire nation, not just a select few states. This would encourage them to understand and address the concerns of all Americans, making the election process more inclusive and representative of our diverse country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a controversial system that many believe should be replaced with a popular vote approach. This would make voting fairer, encourage higher voter turnout, and ensure that every vote counts equally. As middle schoolers, we should educate ourselves about the electoral process and make informed decisions about what we think is best for our country. After all, one day, it will be up to us to shape the future of democracy.
