The Electoral Vote: Improving Elections for Everybody

The presidential election is a crucial event in our country, as it determines who will be the leader of the United States. While the electoral vote is currently used, there are some aspects that could be improved to ensure a fair and just system for everyone.

One issue that many young people, like myself, have with the electoral vote system is that it sometimes feels like our individual votes don't matter as much as they should. In a direct popular vote, every vote would count equally, giving everyone an equal voice in the election process.

To improve the electoral vote system, one possible solution would be to implement a proportional allocation of electors. Currently, most states have a "winner-takes-all" system, where the candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote in a state receives all of the stateâ€™s electoral votes. This can sometimes lead to a candidate winning the electoral vote, even if they did not receive the majority of the popular vote nationwide. By allocating electors proportionally, it would better represent the will of the people and ensure that no vote is wasted.

Another improvement would be to eliminate the "faithless elector" phenomenon. In some cases, an elector might vote for a candidate different from the one they pledged to support. This goes against the principle of representative democracy, where elected officials are expected to uphold their promises. By imposing penalties or stricter regulations on faithless electors, we can ensure that the electoral vote truly reflects the will of the people.

Furthermore, the electoral vote has been criticized for discouraging voter turnout. In "safe" states where one candidate is favored to win, some people may feel that their vote does not matter. This can lead to apathy and disengagement from the election process. To address this, implementing ranked choice voting or increasing civic education could help encourage participation and make the electoral process more inclusive.

In conclusion, the current electoral vote system has its flaws and there are ways to improve it. A direct popular vote, proportional allocation of electors, elimination of faithless electors, and increasing voter turnout are all areas that could be addressed to ensure a fair and representative election process. It is important that we strive for a system that values and respects the votes of every individual, as the outcome of the election impacts all of us.
