Hello! In this essay, I will be discussing the exciting world of seagoing and how it compares to being a cowboy. Seagoing is an adventurous job that requires bravery, skill, and a love for the open waters. It is like being a cowboy on the sea, navigating the vast ocean instead of the wild western landscape.

One thing I need to mention is the importance of teamwork when you're seagoing. Just like cowboys have to work together to herd cattle, seagoing professionals rely on each other to handle the various tasks on a ship. From steering the vessel to maintaining the engine, every job is crucial for a successful journey. Without a strong team, the ship would be like a cowboy without his horse, impossible to accomplish anything.

If I were to choose between being a cowboy and seagoing, I would probably pick being a seagoing professional. Although being a cowboy is an exciting job, the vastness and unpredictability of the ocean attract me more. Just imagining the waves crashing against the hull of the ship, as if they were wild stallions, gives me a sense of adventure.

However, seagoing is not solely about excitement and adventure; it is also a job that requires hard work and dedication. Just like cowboys need to take care of their horses, seagoing professionals need to take care of their ships. Maintaining the vessel's condition, ensuring its safety, and following protocols are all part of the job.

Furthermore, the job of a seagoing professional is not only about the individual, but it also contributes to something greater. For instance, during the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) period after World War II, seagoing professionals played a crucial role in delivering aid to affected areas. Their efforts helped bring supplies and relief to those in need, making their job not just good, but noble as well.

In conclusion, seagoing is an exciting career filled with adventure, teamwork, and the opportunity to contribute to a greater cause. It is like being a cowboy, but on the sea, navigating through the vast ocean instead of the wild west. If you have a love for the water, a desire to work with a team, and a sense of responsibility, a seagoing career might just be the right thing for you. So, set sail and embrace the thrilling journey of being a seagoing professional!
