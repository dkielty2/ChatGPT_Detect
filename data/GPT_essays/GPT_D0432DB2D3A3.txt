The Electoral College: A Popular Mess

The process of electing a president in the United States is a complex and sometimes confusing one. It revolves around a system called the Electoral College, which many people believe is in serious need of change. As a 6th to 12th grader, I think it's important for us to understand why the electoral vote can be seen as a popular mess.

First and foremost, the idea that the president is not elected solely by the popular vote just seems unjust. In our democracy, shouldn't the person who receives the most votes win? It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that a candidate can win the popular vote but still lose the election. This happened in 2016, and it left many people feeling cheated and disillusioned with the system.

The Electoral College was created in a different time, when communication and transportation were much more difficult. The founding fathers believed that electors, who were meant to be knowledgeable individuals, would make better decisions than the average voter. But in today's age of information, this argument seems outdated. We have the ability to research candidates and make informed decisions ourselves. Why do we still need an intermediary?

Another problem with the Electoral College is its bias towards smaller states. Each state gets a certain number of electors based on its representation in Congress. This means that a state with a small population could have more influence per voter than a state with a large population. It's not fair that my vote in a larger state may have less impact than someone's vote in a smaller state. It creates an imbalance of power and undermines the principle of "one person, one vote."

Furthermore, the winner-takes-all system used by most states in the Electoral College can lead to a lack of representation for minority groups. In states that are heavily skewed towards one party, the votes of those who support the opposing party are essentially wasted. This can discourage people from participating in the election process altogether.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a popular mess that needs to be addressed. We need a system that is fair, transparent, and representative of the will of the people. It is time to seriously think about the need for electoral reform and consider alternative methods of electing our president. Our democracy deserves better, and we, as the future of this nation, have the power to bring about change.
