Phones have become an essential part of our lives today. It's hard to imagine a world without them. If I could go anywhere, I would choose to go back to a time when everyone did not have a phone. There are several reasons why this would be a great change for our society.

Firstly, if we didn't have phones, we would have more face-to-face interactions. Nowadays, people are constantly on their phones, and it's rare to see a group of friends having a conversation without someone checking their device. If we didn't have phones, we would be able to talk to each other more and build stronger relationships.

Another reason I would choose to go to a time without phones is because of the distractions they bring. Students are often tempted to use their phones during class, which can negatively impact their learning. If phones were not allowed in schools, students would be more focused on their studies and could achieve better academic results.

If there was a policy against using phones during lunchtime, students would have more time to socialize and enjoy their meals. Nowadays, lunchtime is often spent with everyone looking down at their phones instead of engaging in conversations with their peers. Having a phone-free lunch policy would encourage students to connect with each other and form stronger friendships.

Furthermore, if we didn't have phones, we would have more time for productive activities. Many people spend hours scrolling through social media or playing games on their phones, achieving nothing productive. Without the constant distraction of phones, people could use their time more efficiently and pursue their hobbies or work on personal growth.

Lastly, if we didn't have phones, we would have the freedom to disconnect and be truly present in the moment. Often, people feel the need to constantly check their phones for notifications or updates, fearing that they might miss out on something. Without phones, we would be able to fully enjoy our surroundings and live in the present without the constant distractions of technology.

In conclusion, I believe that if we could go back in time and not have phones, it would greatly benefit our society. We would have more face-to-face interactions, be less distracted, have more time for productive activities, and be able to disconnect and fully enjoy the present. So let's put down our phones every once in a while and embrace the world around us, because there is nothing more free than being truly present.
