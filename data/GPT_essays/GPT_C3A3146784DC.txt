Phones: The Unspoken Battle at School

Phones have become a significant part of our daily lives. Everyone seems to have one, and they have become a popular tool for communication and entertainment. However, in school, the relationship between phones and students is quite problematic. Many schools have strict policies prohibiting phone use during school hours, while others embrace a more lenient approach. As a 6-12 grader, I often find myself torn between understanding why schools are so strict about phone usage and feeling frustrated with this policy.

Firstly, I understand why schools have implemented such policies. Phones can be a major distraction in the learning environment. Many students tend to get absorbed in their phones and lose focus on their studies. I've witnessed classmates sneakily texting under their desks during class, or scrolling through social media instead of paying attention. It is extremely disrespectful to the teacher and disrupts the flow of the lesson. Additionally, phones can be misused to cheat on tests or share inappropriate content. These are legitimate concerns that schools have in mind when creating phone policies.

However, one thing that bothers me about this policy is that sometimes, students actually have valid reasons to use their phones during school hours. For instance, there might be emergencies or urgent messages from parents or guardians that require immediate attention. Without phone access, students may feel anxious and worried about not being able to address the situation. Moreover, phones can also be used as educational tools. Many apps and websites provide helpful resources for learning and researching. By completely banning phones, schools may be limiting our access to valuable information.

Another aspect to consider is lunchtime. I don't understand why the policy extends to this period as well. During lunch, students should be allowed to unwind and socialize. Phones can be a means of communication and connection with friends and family, even if it's just for a short while. It seems wrong to deprive us of this opportunity during that specific time when it does not interfere with academic activities.

In conclusion, while I understand the reasons behind schools' strict phone policies, there are aspects that need reevaluation. Schools should try to find a balance between allowing phone usage for emergencies and educational purposes, while still ensuring that classrooms remain focused and distraction-free. Additionally, it would be beneficial to reconsider the phone policy during lunch, as it is a time for students to relax and connect with others. The important thing is to remember that phones can be both a tool and a distraction, and finding the middle ground is crucial for fostering a positive academic environment.
