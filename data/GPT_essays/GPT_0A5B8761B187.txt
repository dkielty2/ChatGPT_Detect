These extra-curricular activities also enable students to make new friends with similar interests, broadening their social circle and making their school experience more enjoyable.

Academic Competitions:
Apart from regular coursework, schools often organize academic competitions and events. These events challenge students to showcase their academic prowess and compete with peers from other schools. Participating in academic competitions not only enhances our knowledge and understanding of various subjects, but also boosts our confidence and encourages us to strive for excellence.
