In this essay, I will share my thoughts on how the best way to try harder and make the most out of school.

Finding Activities we Like:
Engaging in activities that we enjoy is important to stay motivated and committed to school.

This involves being organized, completing assignments on time, paying attention in class, and actively participating in discussions. A good student is someone who takes pride in their work and actively seeks ways to improve themselves academically and socially.

Trying harder doesn't mean overexerting ourselves or overwhelming our schedules. It means putting in the necessary effort to achieve our goals and make progress. Setting realistic, achievable goals and developing a study plan can greatly enhance our ability to try harder. It's important to stay focused and motivated, even when facing challenges and setbacks. Remember, trying harder doesn't guarantee immediate success, but it cultivates important skills such as perseverance, determination, and resilience.

Making School a Better Place:
We, as students, play an essential role in making school a better place for everyone. By being respectful and kind to our peers and teachers, we create a positive and inclusive environment. Offering help to classmates who might be struggling, actively participating in classroom discussions, and supporting school events are all ways to contribute to the school community. Together, we can make our school a safe and welcoming place for everyone to learn and grow.

Conclusion:
