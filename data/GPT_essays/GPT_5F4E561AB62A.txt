Title: The Unfair New Policy in Class

Introduction:
Hey everyone! Today, I want to discuss a new policy in our school that seems pretty unfair to us kids. It's about time we speak up and let our voices be heard. The policy I'm referring to is the new grading system in our class, and I have some concerns I'd like to share.

Body:
Firstly, let's talk about the grades we receive. As kids, we always strive to get good grades. We work hard, study, and put in the effort to do well. But with the new policy, it feels like our hard work is not being recognized. The grading system seems confusing, and it's hard to understand what exactly earns us a good grade.

Furthermore, the new policy doesn't take into account how much we've improved over time. As students, we're still learning and growing, and sometimes it takes a bit longer to grasp certain concepts. It's unfair that we are penalized for not fully understanding a topic right away. The previous grading system allowed for more flexibility and rewarded our efforts to improve.

Additionally, the new policy leaves us feeling helpless. It seems like the teacher is not willing to work with us or provide the necessary support to help us improve our grades. In the past, teachers were always there to guide and assist us when we struggled. But now, it feels like the focus is solely on the grades, rather than helping us truly understand the material.

Another point that adds to the unfairness of this policy is its impact on our overall performance. Since the new grading system is so rigid, it puts pressure on us to always aim for the highest grade possible. This can lead to anxiety and stress, making it difficult for us to enjoy the learning process. School should be a place where we feel motivated and excited to learn, not a place where we are constantly worried about our grade.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the new grading policy in our class is inherently unfair. As kids, we want to receive grades that reflect our effort and growth. We need a policy that recognizes our progress and provides us with the necessary support to succeed. It's important for us to voice our concerns and work towards a system that is more balanced and beneficial for all students. So let's stand together and advocate for a fair grading system that truly reflects our abilities and helps us grow as learners.
