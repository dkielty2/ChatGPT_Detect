The Electoral College: A Fair System or Undemocratic?

In the United States, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in electing the President. This system, established by our founding fathers, ensures that every state has a say in the presidential election. However, some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic and unfair. As a 6-12 grader, I wanted to explore this topic further.

The Electoral College is a body of electors appointed by each state to formally elect the President. Each state gets a specific number of electors based on the total number of seats they have in Congress. This means that states with larger populations have a greater number of electors, giving them more influence in electing the President. For example, California, with its high population, has 55 electors, while smaller states like Wyoming have only three. This distribution of electors helps to maintain a balance between large and small states.

During a presidential election, voters do not directly vote for the presidential candidate. Instead, they vote for a group of electors who then cast their votes for the candidate if they win the majority of votes in their respective states. This indirect voting process can sometimes lead to a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. This happened in both the 2000 and 2016 elections, where the winner of the popular vote did not become President.

Critics argue that this system is undemocratic because it diminishes the value of individual votes. They believe that every citizen's vote should be counted equally, regardless of where they live. Additionally, they point out that the Electoral College can sometimes lead to candidates focusing disproportionately on swing states, neglecting the concerns of states that are seen as decided in their favor.

However, proponents of the Electoral College argue that it ensures that the views and concerns of smaller states are not overshadowed by larger states. Without the Electoral College, candidates might solely focus on densely populated areas, potentially neglecting the needs of less populous regions. Additionally, they argue that the system prevents controversies surrounding the counting and recounting of votes in close races since each state's electors cast their votes based on the winner of their state's popular vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a unique system that ensures that every state has a voice in electing the President. While it may have its flaws, it aims to strike a balance between the interests of large and small states. However, efforts have been made to reform or eliminate the Electoral College in favor of a direct popular vote. Whether one views the system as fair or undemocratic often depends on personal perspective and values. As future voters, it is important for us to engage in discussions about the Electoral College and its impact on our democracy.
