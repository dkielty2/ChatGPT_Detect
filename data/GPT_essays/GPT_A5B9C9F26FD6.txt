Activities in School

As a student, there are many activities that I would want to be a part of in school. After all, the principal always encourages us to explore different interests and engage in extracurricular activities. However, it is unfortunate that some students feel forced to start activities due to certain pressures. While I understand the importance of including everyone, true passion and enthusiasm should be the driving force behind participating in activities.

In my opinion, extracurricular activities should be a choice, not an obligation. Students should have the freedom to select the activities they are genuinely interested in and enjoy. This way, they can fully immerse themselves in the experience and enhance their skills in these areas. When students are forced into participating in activities they have no interest in, it becomes more of a burden than a learning opportunity.

Every student is unique and has different talents and passions. Some may enjoy playing a musical instrument, while others may thrive on the sports field. There are also those who have a flair for drama or a love for community service. With a wide range of activities available, every student has the opportunity to find something that speaks to their interests and strengths.

One might argue that a variety of activities can provide personal growth and expose students to new experiences. While this is true, it is important for the school to create an environment that encourages students to explore these activities willingly. By fostering a supportive and inclusive community, students will naturally be more willing to step out of their comfort zones and try new things.

Furthermore, the school should also focus on providing quality resources and opportunities for students to engage in these activities. For instance, the music department can offer various instrument options and provide training from skilled teachers. Similarly, the sports teams can have dedicated coaches who can nurture the talent and potential of students.

In conclusion, as a student, I firmly believe that activities in school should be a personal choice, driven by passion and interest. The principal and teachers should encourage and support students in finding activities they genuinely enjoy. By promoting a positive and inclusive environment, the school can help students grow and develop their skills and talents while ensuring that activities remain a source of enjoyment rather than a burden.
