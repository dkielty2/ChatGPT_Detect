My School Activities and Policy

School is a place where we not only learn but also have the opportunity to engage in various activities. One of the favorite activities that students get to participate in is playing sports. Being an athlete myself, I think sports play an essential role in our overall development.

When I get the chance to play sports, it feels like I'm in a different world altogether. As an athlete, I get to showcase my skills and improve my physical abilities. Whether it's running, jumping, or catching a ball, playing sports helps me stay fit and active. I also believe that being part of a team teaches us valuable lessons about teamwork, communication, and discipline.

However, there is one policy that I think could make the sports experience even better in our school. It would be great if the school could provide more opportunities for students to participate in a variety of sports, rather than just focusing on a few popular ones. This way, every student can find a sport they enjoy and excel in. A diverse range of sport options would not only cater to different interests but also allow students to discover new talents they may not have known they had.

Moreover, engaging in sports at school can have long-term benefits for our college applications. Many colleges consider athletic achievements when looking at applicants. Therefore, actively participating in sports during our school years may increase our chances of getting into a good college. It shows dedication, passion, and the ability to balance academics and extracurricular activities, which colleges value.

Apart from sports, there are other activities in school that I think are good for personal growth. For example, being part of a class debate or discussion allows us to express our thoughts and think critically. These activities promote creativity, analytical thinking, and public speaking skills. They also help us develop confidence in presenting our ideas to others.

In conclusion, school is not just about academics, but also about engaging in various activities. Sports, for instance, provide opportunities to get active, be part of a team, and develop important life skills. However, it would be beneficial if schools had a policy that offered a wider range of sports options for students. Additionally, other activities such as class debates can enhance our thinking abilities and build our confidence. Ultimately, participating in these activities during our school years may have a positive impact on our college applications and future endeavors.
