Title: The Power of Voting: A Look into the Electoral College

Introduction:
Did you know that our vote is paramount in deciding who becomes the President of our nation? As citizens, we hold the government accountable through voting, a fundamental practice in our democratic society. One crucial aspect of this process is the Electoral College. In this essay, we will explore how the electoral vote determines the winner of the presidential election and why some people want to replace it with a popular vote system.

The Electoral College:
The Electoral College is a method through which the President of the United States is elected. Each state has a certain number of electoral votes based on its population size, which is determined by the number of representatives it has in Congress. To win the presidency, a candidate must secure a majority of these electoral votes, rather than simply winning the popular vote. This means that a candidate can become President without winning the most individual votes nationwide, as seen in previous elections.

Why People Want Change:
Some argue that the Electoral College should be replaced with a system where the presidential candidate who wins the most individual votes, or the popular vote, wins the election. They believe that this change would better represent the will of the people and ensure that the candidate with the most widespread support becomes President. Under the current system, it is possible for a candidate to win the electoral vote while losing the popular vote, leading to discussions of whether this truly reflects the democratic ideals upon which our nation was founded.

The National and Popular Vote:
In recent years, the discrepancy between the national and popular votes has sparked debates about the legitimacy of the Electoral College. The outcome of the 2016 presidential election serves as a prime example. While one candidate won the majority of the electoral vote, the other candidate secured a higher number of popular votes nationwide. This discrepancy has raised concerns about the fairness of the electoral system, leading to calls for reform.

Conclusion:
Voting is the backbone of our democratic society, and the Electoral College plays a significant role in the presidential election process. Understanding the electoral vote and its impact on determining the winner is crucial for every citizen. While some people argue for a popular vote system to select the President, the Electoral College remains a pillar of our democracy. In the end, it is important for us, as young citizens, to continue engaging in discussions about the future of our electoral system, as it directly affects our nation's leadership and the representation of our voices.
