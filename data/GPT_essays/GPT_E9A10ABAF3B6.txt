School is a place where students gather every day to gain knowledge and learn important skills that will help them navigate through life. But besides the regular classes, there are also various activities that would make school even more enjoyable and beneficial for students.

One activity that would greatly benefit every student is participating in extracurricular activities. These activities are often not mandatory, but they provide students with an opportunity to explore their passions and interests. Whether it's joining a sports team, a debate club, or even the school choir, these activities allow students to spend their time doing something they love. Furthermore, extracurricular activities help students develop essential skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. This is undoubtedly good for the child's overall personal growth.

Another aspect that students would appreciate is having some free time during their school day. It's true that school is essential for acquiring knowledge, but it can also be mentally exhausting. Allowing students to have some free time between classes would provide them with an opportunity to relax, recharge, and socialize with their peers. This would also give them a chance to pursue their own interests, engage in hobbies, or simply take a break from the structured environment of the classroom.

While extracurricular activities and free time are valuable, it's important to remember that the core focus of school should still be academics. Mandatory subjects and classes play a crucial role in a student's education. They provide the foundation for future learning and equip students with necessary skills and knowledge. Although some students may find certain subjects challenging or uninteresting, they are essential for a well-rounded education. Teachers and parents should work together to ensure that students understand the importance of these subjects so that they can fully benefit from them.

In conclusion, school should not only be about mandatory classes and academic achievements, but also about providing students with meaningful activities and free time. Extracurricular activities allow students to explore their passions and develop important skills, while free time provides them with a much-needed break and an opportunity to pursue personal interests. However, it's crucial to remember that mandatory subjects and classes are the foundation of a well-rounded education and should not be overlooked. By balancing these aspects, schools can create an environment that supports students' personal growth and academic success.
