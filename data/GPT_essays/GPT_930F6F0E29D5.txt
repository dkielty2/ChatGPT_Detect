Every student knows the importance of school in their lives. It is the place where we spend a significant portion of our time, striving to achieve good grades and secure a bright future. The average student spends around six to seven hours at school every day, engaging in various activities that contribute to their growth and development. 

One particular aspect of school that affects every student is the school's policy on grading. As students, we work hard to maintain a good grade average, which is calculated based on our performance in tests, assignments, and class participation. However, sometimes we feel that the grading policy might need some changes to make it fairer and more beneficial to the students.

One area where a change in policy could be beneficial is the use of a grading scale. Currently, most schools use a traditional A-F grading scale, where an A denotes excellent performance and an F indicates failure. However, this scale does not accurately reflect a student's actual abilities. For example, a student who consistently receives a grade of C might still possess a good understanding of the subject matter but struggle with test-taking. 

Implementing a different grading scale, perhaps one that includes pluses and minuses, could provide a more accurate representation of a student's performance. This change might not only motivate students to improve their understanding of the subjects but also reduce the pressure associated with letter grades.

Additionally, allowing students the freedom to choose from a wider variety of extracurricular activities can have many positive impacts. Currently, many schools have limited options for extracurricular involvement, primarily focusing on sports or academic clubs. While these activities are undoubtedly beneficial, students might have other interests or talents that aren't catered to by the current offerings.

By expanding the range of extracurricular activities available, schools can ensure that every student has the opportunity to explore their passions and develop skills beyond the scope of the regular curriculum. This change can foster creativity, teamwork, and leadership qualities in students, leading to a more well-rounded education.

In conclusion, making changes to the school's grading policy and increasing the variety of extracurricular activities can greatly benefit students. A modified grading scale that accurately reflects a student's capabilities can provide a clearer picture of their strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, expanding the range of extracurricular offerings can enable students to explore their passions and develop essential life skills. By implementing these changes, schools can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for their students, paving the way for their success.
