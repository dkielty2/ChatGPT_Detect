The Electoral Presidency: A Closer Look at Voting Systems

In the United States, the act of casting a vote is a crucial part of our democratic process. As citizens, we have the power to shape our nation's future by electing our leaders. However, the way we elect our president has often been a topic of debate. The Electoral College, a system that would allocate votes to each state based on its population, is the current method used. Many argue that this method undermines the popular vote and that a direct popular vote system would be fairer.

The purpose of the Electoral College is to give representation to each state. Each state is given a certain amount of electoral votes, based on its population. This system ensures that no matter the size of the state, it would have a voice in the electoral process. For example, a smaller state like Rhode Island would still get a say in the final outcome of the election. It prevents larger states from having complete control over the election, making the system more balanced.

However, critics argue that the popular vote should determine the outcome of the presidential election. They believe that every citizen's vote should be counted equally, regardless of the state they reside in. Under a popular vote system, the candidate who receives the most votes from the people would directly become the president. This would eliminate the issue of candidates winning the electoral vote but losing the popular vote, which has happened in several elections.

The Electoral College also has the potential to create swing states. These states, such as Ohio or Florida, tend to have a significant impact on the final outcome of the election. Candidates often focus their campaigning efforts on these states, neglecting others. This leads to an imbalance in terms of how much attention each state receives. In a popular vote system, every vote would hold equal weight, and candidates would have to appeal to voters nationwide.

Nevertheless, changing the electoral system would require a constitutional amendment. It is not a simple task to amend the Constitution, as it requires the approval of two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as ratification by three-fourths of the states. This process would require considerable effort and time.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system gives representation to each state and balances the power between states of different sizes. However, there are drawbacks, such as swing states and the possibility of a candidate winning the electoral vote while losing the popular vote. While the idea of a direct popular vote may seem fairer, changing the system would be a challenging task. It is important for us, the people, to stay informed on the voting systems and to voice our opinions on how our future presidents should be elected.
