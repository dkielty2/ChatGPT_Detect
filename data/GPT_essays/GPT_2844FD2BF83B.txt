Online classes can significantly reduce confusion for students, especially those who find it challenging to follow along in a traditional classroom setting. Virtual classes allow students to learn at their own pace, replay lectures, and review course content as needed. This feature not only helps students retain information but also enables them to grasp difficult concepts with greater ease. Additionally, online lessons often incorporate visual aids, such as diagrams and charts, which can further enhance comprehension and reduce confusion among students.
