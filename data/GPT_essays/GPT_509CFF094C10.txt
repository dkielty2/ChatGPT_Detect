History comes alive as we visit ports that were once significant during the war, reminding us of the sacrifices made for peace. It's a chance to appreciate the diversity of our world and cultivate a sense of empathy and understanding.

In conclusion, Seagoing Adventures with Luke is an incredible program that offers young students like me the chance to embark on seagoing journeys.
