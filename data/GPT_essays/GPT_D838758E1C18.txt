Title: The Rise of Driverless Cars: A Revolution in Transportation 

Introduction:
In recent years, driverless cars have emerged as a mind-boggling marvel of technology. These futuristic vehicles rely on computer systems to operate autonomously, without the need for human drivers. While some people may be skeptical of such a revolutionary idea, there are several key reasons why driverless cars are on the rise. In this essay, we will explore the causes behind their development, the fail-proof systems implemented, and the potential hazards associated with this groundbreaking technology.

Body:

1. The Cause for Driverless Cars:
The primary driving force behind the development of driverless cars is the desire to improve road safety. Human error is the leading cause of accidents worldwide, with distractions, fatigue, and intoxication impairing judgment. By eliminating the element of human error, driverless cars aim to revolutionize road safety and significantly reduce the number of accidents.

2. The Computer Systems:
Driverless cars rely on complex computer systems equipped with advanced sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms. These systems continuously monitor the car's surroundings, identify obstacles, and make split-second decisions to ensure a smooth and secure ride. The reason these systems are so crucial is that they can process vast amounts of data far quicker than any human driver could ever hope to achieve.

3. Fail-Safe Measures:
To address concerns regarding system failures, driverless cars are designed with multiple redundancies to ensure fail-safe measures are in place. Backup systems and algorithms are implemented to prevent any potential malfunctions from causing accidents. Regular maintenance and software updates are also essential components to rectify any system weaknesses and enhance overall safety.

4. The Risk of Hacking:
Despite the advanced security measures, the potential risk of hacking driverless cars remains a prominent concern. There is a critical need for developers to establish robust cybersecurity protocols to prevent malicious actors from gaining unauthorized access to the car's computer systems. By investing in state-of-the-art encryption and constant monitoring, the chances of hacking could be significantly reduced.

Conclusion:

Driverless cars have shown enormous potential for revolutionizing the way we travel. With the primary cause being road safety, autonomous vehicles equipped with fail-safe computer systems promise reduced accidents caused by human error. Although concerns such as hacking remain, the deployment of stringent security measures can certainly mitigate these risks. As technology continues to evolve, these autonomous vehicles hold the potential to transform transportation, making it safer and more efficient for people all over the world.
