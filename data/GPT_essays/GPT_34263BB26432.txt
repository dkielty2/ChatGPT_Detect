The Electoral College: A System That Could Use Some Change

When it comes to electing our President, the Electoral College is the system we currently use in the United States. But is it the best way to choose our leader? Many people, including myself, feel that there are some flaws in this system that need to be addressed.

Firstly, let's talk about what the Electoral College actually is. It is a group of representatives from each state who vote for the President based on the results of the popular vote in their state. Each state has a certain number of electors, which is determined by the size of its population. This means that some states have more power in electing the President than others, which doesn't seem fair to me.

One thing I would like to change about the Electoral College is the winner-takes-all system that is used in most states. This means that if a candidate wins the majority of votes in a state, they receive all of that state's electoral votes. I believe this discourages voters who support other candidates, as their vote feels like it doesn't really matter. I think a more proportional system, where electoral votes are divided based on the percentage of votes received, would be a fairer way to determine the President.

Another aspect of the Electoral College that needs updating is the way it can sometimes lead to a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote. We saw this happen in the 2016 election when Donald Trump became President, even though Hillary Clinton received more overall votes. This can be confusing and frustrating for voters, who may feel like their vote didn't actually matter. I think the system should be changed so that the candidate who wins the most votes nationwide becomes the President, ensuring that the will of the people is truly represented.

There is also the issue of swing states, which hold a lot of power in deciding the outcome of the election. These are states that could go either way in terms of party affiliation and receive a lot of attention and campaign visits from candidates. I believe this concentrates too much power in a few key states, while leaving other states feeling ignored. A more balanced system would give each state an equal chance to influence the outcome and allow candidates to campaign in all states, not just a select few.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has its flaws and could benefit from some changes. A more proportional allocation of electoral votes, a focus on the popular vote, and an equal distribution of campaign efforts could make the system fairer and more reflective of the will of the people. As future voters, it is important for us to question these systems and advocate for change when we see the need.
