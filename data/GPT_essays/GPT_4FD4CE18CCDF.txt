Advice is something that we all need from time to time. Whether it's from a parent, teacher, or even a friend, advice can help us become better individuals. One piece of advice that I find particularly useful is to surround myself with positive people.

People play a significant role in our lives. We interact with multiple individuals on a daily basis, and their energy and attitude can have a profound impact on us. For instance, if we spend time with someone who is always negative and complaining, it can bring us down and make us feel worse about ourselves. On the other hand, being around positive people can uplift us and make us feel better about ourselves.

An example of a person who embodies this piece of advice is my best friend Sarah. She is always optimistic and has a positive outlook on life. Her positive energy is contagious, and whenever I am around her, I feel motivated and inspired. Sarah constantly encourages me to pursue my dreams and supports me in everything I do. She is always there to lift me up when I am feeling down, and I am grateful to have her in my life.

They say that we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with. This means that if we surround ourselves with positive and motivated individuals, we are more likely to adopt those qualities ourselves. Therefore, it is essential to choose our friends wisely and ensure that they have a positive influence on us.

If we want to be better individuals, we need to be selective about the people we associate with. This does not mean that we should cut off everyone who is not positive, but rather, we should limit our exposure to negativity. It's okay to distance ourselves from people who constantly bring us down, as our mental well-being is crucial.

Furthermore, advice is not only about receiving, but also about giving. When we see someone struggling or feeling down, it's essential to offer support and kind words. Sometimes all someone needs is a listening ear and a few uplifting words to make their day a little better. We can be that someone for others.

In conclusion, surrounding ourselves with positive people can greatly impact our lives. By choosing to be around individuals who uplift and inspire us, we can become better individuals ourselves. An example of a person who embodies this is my best friend Sarah. So let's remember, choose our friends wisely, be that positive person for others, and let's strive to create a better world for ourselves and those around us.
