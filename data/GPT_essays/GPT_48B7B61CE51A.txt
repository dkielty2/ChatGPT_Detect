Phones: A Student's Perspective

In today's world, cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, policies regarding their use in schools vary widely. As a student, I would like to share my thoughts on why I think having the freedom to use our phones during certain times would be a better policy.

First of all, let's talk about time. As students, we spend a significant amount of time at school. During breaks or downtime, having access to our phones can be a great way to pass the time. Whether it's listening to music, watching a funny video, or browsing through social media, phones offer a way to relax and unwind, even if just for a few minutes. This small break can help us recharge and refocus, ultimately leading to better productivity in the classroom.

One reason why I believe this policy would be better is that it encourages creativity and critical thinking. With access to our phones, we can explore and learn about various topics that interest us. For example, if we come across a fascinating article or video, we can easily share it with our classmates and engage in meaningful discussions. This allows us to expand our knowledge beyond what is covered in textbooks and encourages us to think critically about the world around us.

Moreover, having our phones at school can be quite practical. For instance, if I forget to bring a note or a textbook, I can quickly access them online. Additionally, many educational apps can provide us with helpful resources to aid our learning process. Having these tools readily available on our phones would undoubtedly enhance our educational experience.

Some may argue that phones can be distracting and hinder our learning. While this is a valid concern, it is essential to highlight that it ultimately comes down to personal responsibility. By setting guidelines and boundaries, students can be taught to use their phones responsibly and without causing disruption in class.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that students should be allowed to use their phones during designated times at school. The freedom to access our phones can contribute positively to our overall learning experience. Whether it's for entertainment, staying organized, or expanding our knowledge, phones have the potential to enhance our educational journey. When used responsibly, they can be valuable tools that empower students to think critically and communicate effectively. Therefore, I would encourage schools to consider implementing policies that embrace responsible phone usage in the best interest of students and their education.
