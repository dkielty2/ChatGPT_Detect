Flexibility of Time and Schedule (80 words):
One major advantage of online school is the flexibility it offers to students. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar schools, online classes allow students to structure their time according to their individual needs. This means students can complete their classwork at a time that suits them best. For instance, some students may thrive in the early morning, while others prefer to work late at night. The flexibility of online school enables students to customize their schedules, ensuring that they can work at their optimum level.

Ability to Work at One's Own Pace (90 words):
Online school also grants students the ability to work at their own pace. In a traditional classroom setting, students may feel rushed or left behind if they are unable to keep up with the pace of their peers. However, with virtual learning, individuals can review and master concepts at a speed comfortable to them. This ensures a deeper understanding of the material. Students who need extra time to grasp a concept are able to do so without any pressure. It also allows for students to move ahead in areas where they excel, fostering a sense of self-confidence.

Focus on Individualized Learning (90 words):
In online classes, there is a greater focus on individualized learning. Unlike in a physical classroom where teachers have to cater to the collective needs of a large group, online instructors can provide personalized attention by addressing each student's unique requirements. They could engage in one-on-one discussions, provide detailed feedback on assignments, and tailor the coursework to meet the differing needs and abilities of students. This individualized learning approach helps students to meet their learning objectives effectively and ensures that they receive the necessary support to succeed.

Conclusion (60 words):
In conclusion, online schooling offers significant advantages for students. It provides them with the flexibility to schedule their time as per their convenience, allowing them to balance school with other commitments. Moreover, online classes facilitate learning at one's own pace, ensuring a deeper understanding of subjects. Lastly, the individualized learning approach enables students to receive personalized attention, enhancing their overall academic growth. Given these benefits, it is clear that online school is a valuable option for students to consider.
