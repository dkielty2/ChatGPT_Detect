Title: Kids Facing the Pressures of Online School

Introduction:
In today's rapidly evolving world, the concept of schooling has expanded beyond traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms. With the advent of technology, students now have the opportunity to pursue their education online. However, this shift comes with its own set of challenges, particularly for kids. In this essay, I will discuss the pressures that students face when it comes to online schooling and how it can affect their ability to get their work done within the given time.

Body:
One of the primary concerns of online schooling is the added pressure students experience. In a physical school environment, there is a sense of routine and structure that helps students focus on their tasks. However, in an online class, kids are responsible for managing their own time and staying motivated. This newfound independence can cause some students to feel overwhelmed or procrastinate, leading to incomplete assignments or a lack of understanding.

Furthermore, the online learning environment can often be distracting for kids. With the world at their fingertips and multiple electronic devices available, the temptation to engage in non-school-related activities is ever-present. The constant influx of notifications from social media and other entertainment platforms can make it challenging for students to stay focused on their schoolwork. This distraction can cause additional stress and hinder their ability to complete assignments in a timely manner.

Another factor that contributes to the pressure kids face is the lack of immediate assistance from teachers. In a physical classroom, students can ask questions or seek clarification from their teachers and classmates. However, in an online setting, reaching out for help can be more intimidating, leading to feelings of frustration or confusion. This feeling can cause a delay in completing assignments, as students may spend excessive time trying to comprehend the material on their own.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, online schooling presents a unique set of challenges for students. The increased pressure, distractions, and lack of immediate assistance can hinder their ability to complete work on time. It is crucial for students and educators to recognize these challenges and work together to find strategies that can help alleviate the pressure. Establishing routines, creating a conducive learning environment, and encouraging open communication can all contribute to a more successful online learning experience. By addressing these issues, we can create a supportive environment that allows kids to thrive academically in the online schooling setting.
