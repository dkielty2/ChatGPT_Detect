The Electoral College: An Unfair System

The electoral system is a crucial aspect of the United States' democracy. It helps determine the president of our country and ensures that the voices of the people are heard. However, the Electoral College, a component of this system, is often deemed unfair and even distorted. This essay will delve into the reasons why this system is flawed and why it is crucial for our democracy to find a more even and voter-centric way of electing our president.

The Electoral College is a process in which each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. Each state then selects electors who cast their votes to determine the presidency. However, this system has its flaws. Firstly, it can lead to an uneven distribution of power. States with larger populations, like California and Texas, have more electoral votes. While this aims to ensure that more populous states have a say, it can overshadow the voices of those in less populous states. Every citizen's vote should matter equally, regardless of where they live.

Additionally, the Electoral College system can result in a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote. This unfairness was evident in the 2016 election when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but still lost the presidency to Donald Trump. This discrepancy leaves many voters feeling unheard and disenfranchised. In a democracy, the candidate who secures the most votes should be the one elected into office.

Another issue lies in the winner-takes-all approach employed by most states. This means that the candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes. This can create a sense of hopelessness for voters whose preferred candidate did not win the majority vote in their state. It discourages people from participating, as they may feel like their vote does not matter.

In order to have a fair and voter-centric electoral system, reforms need to be implemented. One possible solution is the popular vote system, where the candidate who wins the most votes across the nation becomes president. This way, each vote holds equal weight, regardless of location or state size. This ensures that every citizen's voice counts and eliminates the risk of a candidate winning the presidency without the majority vote.

Overall, the Electoral College system in the United States can be seen as unfair and in need of reform. Its uneven distribution of power and the possibility of a candidate winning without the popular vote make it a less democratic system. It is crucial for our democracy to evolve towards a more voter-centric approach, where every vote is valued and included in the determination of our president. By enacting these changes, we can ensure a more equal and fair system that truly represents the will of the people.
