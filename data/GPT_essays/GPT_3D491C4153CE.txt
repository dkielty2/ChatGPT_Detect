Title: Changing School Policies: The Average Student's Perspective

Introduction:
School policies play a crucial role in shaping the educational experience of students. As average students, we want to voice our thoughts on the idea of changing school policies, specifically regarding activities and sports. In this essay, we will explore why we believe these changes are essential for enhancing our school experience.

Body:

1. The need for more diverse activities:
School should be a place where students can explore their interests and passions outside of academics. However, the current average school fails to provide enough activity options. Many students feel limited and want to see a broader range of activities offered. By introducing new activities such as art clubs, music ensembles, drama troupes, and science clubs, schools can cater to a wider range of interests, allowing students to discover and develop new talents.

2. Emphasis on sports:
Sports play a vital role in not only promoting physical fitness but also fostering teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills. However, the current average school places excessive importance on academics, often neglecting the significance of sports. We believe that including a variety of sports options and encouraging student participation will create a more holistic school environment. By promoting balanced development, schools can better prepare students for future challenges.

3. The idea of changing the average grading policy:
The current grading policy tends to focus solely on academic performance, often leading to an unhealthy obsession with achieving high grades. This emphasis can generate unnecessary pressure, hindering our overall growth and well-being. A potential idea for improvement is implementing a holistic grading system that considers factors such as character, effort, and participation in co-curricular activities. By doing so, students can be recognized for their multifaceted achievements, which will foster a healthier and more well-rounded educational culture.

4. Student involvement in decision-making:
To create policies that accurately cater to students' needs, it is essential to involve the student body in the decision-making process. A student council or regular surveys could be introduced to gather input and opinions from average students. By incorporating diverse perspectives and actively listening to student voices, schools can create policies that reflect the desires and interests of the entire student population.

Conclusion:
The average student's experience at school should go beyond academics. We believe that by expanding the range of activities, emphasizing sports, and implementing a holistic grading policy, schools can create a more enriching and inclusive environment. Furthermore, involving students in decision-making processes will ensure that policies accurately represent their interests. Let us strive for positive change and work towards creating a school that caters to the comprehensive growth and development of every student.
