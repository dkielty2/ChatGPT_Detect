The Electoral Vote System: An Unfair Way to Choose Our President

Every four years, the United States holds a presidential election. But did you know that the way we choose our president is not as fair as it seems? The electoral vote system, also known as the Electoral College, sometimes undermines the will of the people and gives more power to certain states.

The electoral vote system is a process where each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. These electoral votes are what ultimately decide who becomes president, not the popular vote. This means that a candidate could win the popular vote, but still lose the election if they don't have enough electoral votes.

This system gives more power to smaller states. Sometimes, a candidate can win the majority of the electoral votes by winning just a few key states, even if they lose the popular vote. For example, in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost three million votes, but Donald Trump won the electoral vote and became president. This discrepancy between the popular vote and the electoral vote can leave many voters feeling like their voices don't really count.

Furthermore, the electoral vote system can create a sense of inequality among states. States with larger populations, like California and Texas, have more electoral votes than smaller states like Rhode Island or Delaware. This means that votes from citizens in these larger states have less weight than those from smaller states. Is this fair? Every vote should count equally, regardless of the state they come from.

In addition, the electoral vote system can sometimes discourage people from voting. When a voter knows that their state is either heavily Democratic or Republican, they may feel like their vote doesn't really matter. This can lead to voter apathy and a decrease in overall voter turnout. We should encourage more people to participate in the democratic process, not discourage them.

So, what are some alternatives to the electoral vote system? One possible solution is the popular vote. This is a system where the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide becomes the president. This would ensure that every vote counts equally, regardless of the state they come from. It would also give a more accurate representation of the will of the people.

In conclusion, the electoral vote system is an unfair way to choose our president. It sometimes undermines the popular vote, gives more power to certain states, and can discourage people from voting. We should strive for a system that is fair, equal, and representative of all citizens. Our democracy deserves nothing less.
