Being a student in grade 6-12, there are many activities that we engage in at school. These activities are not only fun but also help us become better and smarter individuals.

One activity that many students would enjoy is participating in athletic events. Sports such as soccer, basketball, and track and field allow us to stay active and develop physical skills. Through sports, we can learn important values like teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. It would be great if our school could make athletics a priority and offer more opportunities for students to engage in different sports.

Another activity that would greatly benefit students is having a policy that encourages reading. Reading is not only a way to escape into different worlds, but it also helps to expand our vocabulary and improve our writing skills. If the school made reading a regular part of our curriculum, it would definitely make us better readers and ultimately smarter students.

Kids in grades 6-12 have a lot of potential, and it would be great if our school could tap into this potential by offering more hands-on activities. For example, science experiments or art projects would allow us to apply what we learn in class and make the learning experience more enjoyable. By incorporating these interactive activities into our education, we would be able to understand and retain information better.

Additionally, it would be wonderful if our school could provide more opportunities for students to showcase their talents. Whether it's through drama, music, or public speaking, these activities allow us to build confidence and express ourselves creatively. By having regular talent shows or performance events, students would have the chance to shine and share their unique skills with their peers.

In conclusion, as students in grades 6-12, we have many ideas about how our school could be even better. By prioritizing athletics, implementing a reading policy, incorporating hands-on activities, and providing more opportunities for students to showcase their talents, our school could make a significant impact in our education. These changes would not only make us better and smarter individuals but also create a more enjoyable and enriching learning environment for all of us.
