The Electoral College: A System that Must Change

In our democratic society, voting is an essential right that gives power to the people. However, the current electoral college system used to elect the President of the United States has come under scrutiny. As a 6-12 grader, I believe it is time for a change.

The electoral college is a complex system whereby each state is assigned a certain number of electors based on its representation in Congress. These electors then cast their votes to determine the President. While this system may have had its merits in the past, it is no longer the most effective way to choose our leaders.

One of the main problems with the electoral college is that it does not always accurately reflect the will of the people. This is because of the winner-takes-all system used by most states. In this case, even if a candidate wins the popular vote by a small margin, they receive all of the state's electoral votes. This can lead to a situation where the candidate who loses the overall popular vote becomes the President, as we saw in the 2016 election. This undermines the principle of "one person, one vote" that is so important in a democracy.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it can discourage voting, especially in states that are heavily favored towards one party. In these "safe" states, many voters feel that their vote does not matter since the outcome is already predetermined. This can lead to voter apathy and a decrease in overall voter participation.

To address these problems, a more direct system of voting, known as the popular vote, should be adopted. Under this system, the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide would be declared the winner. This would ensure that the will of the majority is always represented.

Furthermore, a change to a popular vote system would incentivize candidates to campaign and reach out to voters in all states, rather than focusing on battleground states with a greater number of electoral votes. This would help ensure that candidates address the concerns of a wider range of citizens and would lead to a more inclusive democracy.

In conclusion, the electoral college system is outdated and unrepresentative of the will of the people. As a young person who will soon be able to vote, I believe it is crucial that we change this system to a popular vote. It is time for our democracy to evolve and adapt to the needs of the modern world. The power to choose our leaders must be in the hands of the people, and it is our duty to strive for a fairer and more equitable electoral system.
