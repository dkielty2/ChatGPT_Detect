Sports and play are crucial for a well-rounded educational experience. Engaging in physical activities allows students to develop teamwork, enhance their social skills, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, participation in sports can help students manage stress and improve their focus, leading to better academic performance.

Despite knowing the benefits of sports and play, many schools do not provide adequate opportunities for students to engage in these activities. Existing policies often prioritize academics over physical activities, resulting in an imbalanced student life.

This includes scheduling sufficient time for physical education classes, introducing more sports options, and organizing regular inter-school competitions that encourage participation.

This, in turn, positively affects their overall academic performance and mental health.
