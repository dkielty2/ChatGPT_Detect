Learning about the statistics, sharing stories of people who have died or been severely injured due to phone-related accidents, and understanding the risks are crucial steps in preventing such incidents. By promoting awareness, we can make a difference in making our roads safer.

3. Responsibility of Drivers:
As drivers, it is our responsibility to prioritize the safety of ourselves, our passengers, and others on the road. We must educate ourselves about the potential dangers and make a conscious effort to avoid phone usage while driving. Instead of relying on calls or text messages, we can consider using hands-free devices or pulling over in a safe location when necessary.

4. Learning from Tragic Incidents:
Tragic incidents where people lost their lives due to phone-related accidents should serve as reminders for everyone. We must understand that the consequences of using phones while driving are irreversible. Instead, we need to focus on practicing safe driving habits and being considerate of others on the road. Learning from past incidents can help us prevent future accidents.
