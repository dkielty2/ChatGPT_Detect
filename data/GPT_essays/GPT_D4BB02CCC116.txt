Grade 7 Essay: School Activities and Changes

Being a student in middle school comes with a variety of activities and changes. One of the most exciting aspects of being in seventh grade is getting to participate in different sports. Sports are not only a fun way to stay active, but they also allow students to develop teamwork and discipline.

If I had to choose one sport to represent seventh grade, it would be basketball. This dynamic sport is loved by many students because it challenges our physical abilities and teaches us important skills like communication and coordination. Basketball games during physical education class are always intense, and they definitely get our adrenaline pumping!

However, there is one thing about the sports policy that I would like to change. Currently, only a select number of students are allowed to play on the school's official basketball team. I think it would be fair to let more students have the opportunity to be a part of a competitive team. This would give them a chance to improve their skills and represent our school in games against other schools.

Another change that I would suggest is the implementation of a new grading policy. Right now, our grades are solely based on exams and assignments. I believe it would be beneficial to have more interactive and practical assessments. For example, instead of just writing essays, we could have debates or group projects that would allow us to apply our knowledge in a more engaging way. This would make learning more fun and help us develop important skills such as teamwork and critical thinking.

However, not all changes are for the better. One change that I find particularly bad is the excessive use of technology in the classroom. While technology can be helpful, too much of it can be distracting and detrimental to our learning experience. Some students use their devices for non-educational purposes during class, which is not fair to those who are trying to focus and learn. I believe that teachers should let us use technology for educational purposes only and set clear guidelines to ensure everyone is using it appropriately.

In conclusion, seventh grade is a time filled with exciting activities and changes. Sports like basketball provide us with opportunities to grow physically and develop important life skills. While there are some aspects of school that I would change, like allowing more students to participate in competitive teams and implementing a more interactive grading policy, I also recognize that not all changes are positive. Striking a balance between incorporating technology in the classroom and ensuring it is used responsibly is important for an effective learning environment.
