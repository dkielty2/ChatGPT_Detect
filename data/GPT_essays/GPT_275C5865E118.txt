Title: The Electoral College: An Unfair System That Dilutes the Power of Our Vote

Introduction:
In the United States, the electoral system plays a crucial role in determining the winner of the presidential election. This system, known as the Electoral College, assigns electors from each state who ultimately decide the outcome. However, many students in middle and high school like myself find the electoral system to be unfair and believe that it undermines the value of our votes. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why the electoral system is considered to be unfair, focusing on the role of electors and the dilution of the individual vote.

Body:

The Role of Electors:
One of the main reasons why the electoral system is deemed unfair is due to the role of electors. The number of electors allocated to each state is determined by the state's representation in Congress. Consequently, states with smaller populations have a disproportionate number of electors compared to their population size. For instance, Wyoming, with a population of about 578,000, has three electors, while California, with a population of approximately 39 million, has 55 electors. This discrepancy allows for smaller states to have a greater impact on the overall outcome of the election, making the system unbalanced and unfair.

Dilution of Individual Votes:
Furthermore, the electoral system also dilutes the power of an individual vote. Since the electors vote on behalf of a state, rather than representing the votes of its citizens directly, a candidate can win a state's popular vote by a slim margin and still receive all of that state's electoral votes. This Winner-Takes-All approach disregards the votes of individuals who did not support the winning candidate, giving preference to one party over another. This aspect of the electoral system reduces the influence of minority voters and can lead to feelings of disillusionment among the populace.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the electoral system, though designed to ensure a fair and balanced representation of states in presidential elections, is considered by many students to be deeply unfair. The allocation of electors based on state population size greatly favors smaller states, while the dilution of individual votes leads to the possibility of an unpopular candidate winning the presidency. As young citizens, we believe that our votes should hold equal value and that the Electoral College should be reevaluated to better reflect the will of the people. Only by addressing these fundamental concerns can we truly strengthen our democracy.
