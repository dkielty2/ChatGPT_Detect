The Electoral College: The Flaws in our System

The electoral college has always been a topic of controversy when it comes to electing our president. Many argue that it is an outdated and flawed system, and I have to agree. In this essay, I will discuss the flaws in our current electoral college system and present my own ideas for improvement.

First and foremost, the electoral college undermines the principle of "one person, one vote." In a true democracy, every individual's vote should carry equal weight. However, this is not the case in the electoral college system, where the winner takes all the electoral votes of a state, regardless of the margin of victory. This means that a candidate can win the majority of the popular vote but lose the presidency, as we saw in the 2016 election. It is simply wrong for the candidate with the most votes to lose the election.

Furthermore, the electoral college allows for the possibility of "faithless electors." These are electors who do not vote in accordance with the popular vote of their state. Although this is relatively rare, it is still problematic. Electors should not have the power to override the will of the people. The idea that a small number of electors can potentially change the outcome of an election is undemocratic and undermines the legitimacy of the whole electoral process.

Additionally, the two-party system in the United States is reinforced by the electoral college. Due to the winner-takes-all nature of the system, third-party candidates often have little to no chance of winning any electoral votes. This creates a barrier for new voices and ideas in politics, limiting the choices available to voters. Even if a third-party candidate is able to gain a significant portion of the popular vote, they are unlikely to receive any electoral votes, further discouraging diversity in our elections.

To improve our electoral system, I propose implementing a popular vote system for electing the president. This would ensure that every vote counts equally and that the candidate with the most votes is elected. It would eliminate the possibility of faithless electors and give voters the confidence that their voices are being heard. This change would encourage greater voter participation and engagement in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the electoral college is a flawed system that does not accurately represent the will of the people. It undermines the principles of democracy by allowing the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote and still losing the presidency. It also discourages the emergence of new political parties and ideas. It is time for a change. Let's move towards a popular vote system that truly reflects the majority's choice and ensures a fair and equitable election process.
