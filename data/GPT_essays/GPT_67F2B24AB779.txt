A recent study found that 93 percent of students use technology every day, mainly through smartphones and laptops. This access brings both advantages and challenges to the classroom environment. On one hand, technology allows students to easily access information and enhance their learning experience. For example, students can search the internet to find resources on various topics. On the other hand, excessive screen time can lead to distractions, impacting focus and reducing engagement with a course.

One of the biggest concerns regarding technology is its impact on students' emotional well-being. With the increased dependence on screens, face-to-face interactions are often minimized. As a result, people may feel isolated and disconnected, yearning for genuine connections. Students need to find a balance in their technology use to prioritize social interactions and develop strong interpersonal skills. Additionally, constantly being connected online can lead to pressure and anxiety, as individuals compare themselves to others, creating a sense of "missing out."

While technology has its challenges, it also presents opportunities for emotional expression and support. Tools like texting and instant messaging allow students to express their emotions and seek help when needed. Whether it's sharing excitement over an accomplishment or reaching out for assistance, technology provides an outlet for emotional connection. Additionally, virtual spaces, like online forums or counseling platforms, offer support networks for students who may find it difficult to express themselves in traditional ways.

By leveraging technology for emotional expression and support, students can strengthen their social connections and seek help when needed. Therefore, technology should be seen as a tool for fostering emotional growth and creating a balanced learning environment.
