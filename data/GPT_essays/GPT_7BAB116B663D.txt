Activities in school are always fun! There are so many things I like to do with my friends during the year. One activity that I may participate in is playing volleyball. It's such a great sport that brings everyone together.

Playing volleyball with my friends is so much fun. We get to pass the ball back and forth, and try to score points. Sometimes, we even have small tournaments where different groups compete against each other. It's always exciting to see which team comes out on top!

One thing I don't like about school activities is when we don't get to choose what we want to do. Sometimes, the principal decides what activities we have to join, and we don't have a say in it. I think it would be nice if students were given more options, so we could choose the activities we're interested in.

Another activity I really enjoy is working on our yearbook. We get to see all the memorable moments throughout the school year and put them together in a special book. It's interesting to see how everything comes together, from the design to the captions. It would be amazing if my friend's pictures were featured in the yearbook!

Speaking of friends, they make everything so much better. They are always there to support and have fun with us. We participate in activities together, and it makes the experience even more enjoyable. I'm grateful for my friends because they make my time in school so much more exciting.

Sometimes, I wish we had more activities throughout the year. It would be great to have more options and see what other activities we could try. I'm sure there are many things that students would love to do if given the chance.

Overall, school activities are a great way to have fun and spend time with friends. Whether it's playing volleyball or working on the yearbook, these activities add excitement to the school year. I hope that in the future, we may have more say in the activities we participate in. It would be amazing to have a wide range of options to choose from. Until then, I'll continue to enjoy the activities we have and make the most of my time with friends.
