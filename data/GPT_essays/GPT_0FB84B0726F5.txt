One of the main reasons why drivers are tempted to use their phones while driving is the desire to stay connected. Phones have become an essential device in our lives, providing constant access to communication, entertainment, and information. However, engaging with our phones diverts our attention from the road, putting ourselves and others at risk. It only takes a split second of distraction to cause a serious accident.
