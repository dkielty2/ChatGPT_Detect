The Electoral College: A Fair or Unfair System?

The Electoral College is a system used in the United States to elect the President. As a 6-12 grader, I can see both the positive and negative aspects of this electoral system. However, I believe that it is an unfair system, which ties the power of the people's vote.

One of the main issues with the Electoral College is that it does not directly determine the President based on the popular vote. Instead, each state has a certain number of electors based on its population, and the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes in each state wins all of that state's electoral votes. This means that an individual's vote can be undermined if it does not align with the majority's choice in their state.

For instance, let's say I live in a state where most people vote for Candidate A, but I prefer Candidate B. In this case, my vote for Candidate B would essentially be "wasted," as the electoral votes from my state would go to Candidate A. This makes me feel like my vote doesn't matter and diminishes the significance of individual voices.

Furthermore, the Electoral College can result in a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote. This happened in the 2016 election, where the candidate who received the most electoral votes did not win the majority of the popular vote. This outcome seems unfair and undemocratic because it means that the candidate favored by the majority of people did not become President.

In addition to being unfair, the Electoral College can also be seen as a barrier for citizens who want to run for President. Since the system relies on winning a certain number of electoral votes from different states, candidates often have to concentrate their efforts on states with a higher number of electoral votes, such as those with larger populations. This makes it much more challenging for individuals from smaller states to have a real chance of winning the presidency, as they are often overshadowed by candidates who focus on more populated areas.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an unfair system that ties the power of the people's vote. It undermines the principle of democracy by potentially allowing a candidate who did not win the popular vote to become President. As a 6-12 grader, I believe that a more direct and representative voting system, such as a popular vote, would be a fairer way to elect our nation's leaders. It is posablet to envision a future where the people's voices are truly heard and reflected in the outcome of the Presidential elections.
