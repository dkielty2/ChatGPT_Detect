Title: The Online Classroom Experience: How Students Feel About the New Normal

Imagine waking up, rolling out of bed, and within minutes, you're in your first class of the day. This is the reality for students attending online school. As a student myself, I can't help but ponder how my fellow classmates and I feel about this new way of learning. Would we prefer to be in a physical classroom or are we content with attending class from the comfort of our homes?

One thing is for sure; the convenience of online classes cannot be denied. Students can now have a few extra minutes of sleep since there's no need to rush to catch the school bus. We have the freedom to wear our most comfortable clothes while attending class, allowing us to feel more relaxed and at ease. Moreover, we have the luxury of studying in our own personalized environment, which some students find conducive to learning.

However, despite these advantages, there are drawbacks to online classes that are difficult to ignore. The absence of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers can make it challenging for students to feel connected and engaged. In a physical classroom, students could ask questions and receive immediate guidance, but in an online setting, this process is often delayed, leading to frustration and confusion.

Additionally, the lack of a structured schedule and routine can impact students' motivation. Without the typical bell schedule, some students find it tempting to procrastinate or become easily distracted by other activities. As a result, the quality of work may suffer. Besides, staying at home all day can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can further impact a student's mental well-being.

Moreover, extended screen time during online classes can strain our eyes, causing fatigue and headaches. Students who are suffering from sleep deprivation find it even more challenging to stay focused during classes. The temptation to take a nap or sleep in between classes can disrupt the learning process and hinder academic progress.

Despite these difficulties, it is essential to remember that online classes have also presented unique opportunities. Students can now learn at their own pace and have more flexibility in managing their time. They can review recorded lectures, pause and rewind, enabling a deeper understanding of the material. Additionally, online resources and platforms provide access to a vast array of educational materials that supplement classroom learning.

In conclusion, opinions among students about attending school online are varied. While some appreciate the convenience and personalized environment, others long for the face-to-face interaction and structure of a physical classroom. However, it is clear that the online classroom experience is not without its challenges. From feelings of disconnectedness and isolation to difficulties with motivation and sleep deprivation, students are experiencing a range of emotions. Yet, it is crucial to adapt and make the most of the opportunities provided by online learning, striving for balance and seeking support when needed.
