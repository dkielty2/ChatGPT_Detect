Students and the Online World

Getting distracted is a huge challenge for students when it comes to online learning. With the pandemic forcing us to attend school from home, our environment has dramatically changed, and it is harder to focus on our studies. Many of us want to have a good time and be with our friends, but we need to find a balance between our social lives and our school responsibilities.

One of the reasons why we easily get distracted is that we have access to the internet at home. We can get caught up in scrolling through our social media feeds or watching funny videos on YouTube. It can be tempting to check our phones every few minutes, especially when we receive notifications from our friends. With the constant distractions, our schoolwork often takes a backseat.

Moreover, being at home means having numerous distractions around us. We might want to spend time with our family, play video games, or even just relax in front of the television. It's hard to resist the allure of all these activities when we know we have homework waiting for us. Our home environment should ideally be a place for learning, but it can quickly turn into a place of leisure.

Not only are we responsible for managing our distractions, but sometimes we also have to deal with the distractions caused by other people in our households. Whether it's our siblings, parents, or even pets, they can disrupt our concentration. It can be difficult to focus when there's noise or commotion around us. Finding a quiet and private space is crucial to keeping our attention on our assignments.

Furthermore, completing homework takes a lot more time than it used to. Physically attending school allows for face-to-face interactions with teachers, which makes learning more engaging and efficient. However, the online format often leads to misunderstandings and confusion. We spend a lot of time messaging our teachers and classmates to clarify assignments or seek help. Additionally, studying online requires more self-discipline since we don't have the same structure and routine as we do in school.

In conclusion, being a student in the online world presents various challenges. We want to have a good time and connect with our friends, but we need to find a balance between leisure and schoolwork. The distractions at home, the constant access to the telephone, the additional time spent on homework, and the presence of other people in our environment all contribute to the difficulty of remaining focused. It is important for us students to develop strategies to manage distractions and create an effective learning space, both mentally and physically. Only then can we truly succeed in the online classroom.
