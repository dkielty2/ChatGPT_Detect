The Online Class Experience: How Students Feel About Taking School Work Online

As a student, taking classes online has become the new norm. In today's world, where technology is advancing rapidly, schools have incorporated online learning as a way for students to continue their education, no matter the circumstances. As a 6-12 grader, I can confidently say that online classes come with their own set of challenges and benefits.

One of the biggest advantages of taking school work online is the flexibility it offers. Unlike traditional classrooms, where we have a fixed schedule, online classes allow students to work at their own pace. This means that we can complete assignments and tests at a time that suits us best. It also means that we can manage our time effectively, balancing school work with other commitments.

However, this flexibility can sometimes be a double-edged sword. With no fixed class time, it's easy to procrastinate and leave assignments until the last minute. Without structure, students might find it harder to stay motivated and disciplined. It's crucial for us to develop time management skills and have a routine in place, so we can keep up with the workload.

Another aspect of online learning that students might feel is the lack of face-to-face interaction with classmates and teachers. In a traditional classroom, we can ask questions, have discussions, and collaborate on group projects. Online classes, on the other hand, might feel isolating at times. To overcome this, teachers often incorporate video conferences and discussion boards, which provide opportunities for students to connect with their peers and teachers.

Taking school work online can also change the way we receive feedback on our work. In traditional classrooms, teachers can give immediate feedback, allowing us to make improvements and understand our mistakes. In online classes, feedback might take longer as teachers have to review assignments electronically. However, this also means that our work can be more detailed and thorough, as teachers have more time to evaluate it.

In conclusion, online learning has become an integral part of the student experience in today's world. While it offers flexibility in terms of scheduling and allows for a more detailed feedback, it can also be challenging due to the lack of face-to-face interaction and the need for self-discipline. To excel in online classes, students need to manage their time effectively, stay motivated, and actively participate in virtual discussions. Ultimately, whether a student thrives in an online class or not, depends on their ability to adapt and make the most out of the resources provided.
