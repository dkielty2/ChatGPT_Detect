Dear readers,

Today, I want to talk about some exciting activities and changes that should happen in our school. There are a lot of things that we could do differently to make our school even better!

Firstly, let's discuss the average amount of time we spend on sports at school. Currently, it's only about an hour per week, which isn't quite enough. Sports are super important because they keep us fit and healthy. If we increased the amount of time spent on sports to at least two hours a week, it would be beneficial for everyone. We would have more opportunities to try different sports and find what we're passionate about. Additionally, it would give us a chance to break away from our desks and have some fun!

Another change that would greatly benefit our school is having more clubs and activities. Currently, we only have a few options to choose from, like the band and the debate club. That's great for some, but we need more variety for students with different interests. Adding a robotics club, an art club, or even a cooking club would give us a chance to explore new hobbies and make new friends. I, for one, would love to join a coding club, maybe learn how to create websites or develop video games!

Next, let's address the issue of our grading system. Right now, our school uses the traditional A, B, C grading scale. However, I believe that including pluses and minuses would be more accurate in measuring our performance. For instance, if we receive an 89%, it should be recognized as a solid B+. It's a small change, but it would provide a clearer understanding of our achievements and motivate us to strive for excellence.

Lastly, I think we should have more field trips. Field trips are a fantastic way to learn beyond the walls of our classrooms. They are educational and fun at the same time. Exploring museums, visiting historical sites, or even going on nature walks can greatly enhance our understanding of the subjects we learn in school. Plus, it's a chance to bond with our classmates and create lasting memories.

In conclusion, our school has the potential to become even better with a few changes. Increasing the time spent on sports, adding more clubs, incorporating plus and minus grades, and organizing more field trips would greatly enhance our school experience. I believe that these changes would not only make school more enjoyable, but also provide us with more opportunities to learn, grow, and discover our true passions.

So, let's write a letter to the school administration, expressing our thoughts and suggestions for these changes. Together, we can make our school a place where every student feels empowered, engaged, and excited about learning!

Sincerely,
A motivated student
