The Electoral College: A Problematic System for the People

The electoral system in the United States, known as the Electoral College, has long been a topic of controversy and debate. This unique method of electing a president has its roots in our nation's history, but many people argue that it is outdated and flawed. In this essay, we will explore why the electoral college is a problematic system for the people.

Firstly, let's understand how the electoral college works. During a presidential election, voters cast their ballots for a candidate, but their votes do not directly determine the winner. Instead, each state is assigned a number of electoral votes based on its population, and these votes ultimately decide the winner. This means that the candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote in a state will receive all of that state's electoral votes. 

One of the main problems with the electoral college is that it can lead to the winner of the popular vote losing the election. This has happened multiple times in our history, including the most recent 2016 election. Many people argue that this goes against the principle of democracy, as the candidate with the most votes should win. It is disheartening to see a candidate win the popular vote and still lose the election, as it undermines the voice of the people.

Additionally, the electoral college system often leads to candidates only focusing on battleground states. In this system, it does not matter if a candidate wins a state by a small margin or a large one; they will still receive all of that state's electoral votes. This has created a situation where some states are considered a "safe" win for certain political parties, while others receive much more attention and campaigning. This unequal distribution of focus can leave many people feeling unheard and unrepresented.

Furthermore, the electoral college gives more power to smaller states. Each state, regardless of its population, receives a minimum of three electoral votes, resulting in smaller states having a disproportionate influence in the outcome of the election. This means that a vote in a smaller state carries more weight than a vote in a larger state. While the intention may have been to ensure representation for all states, it can ultimately lead to an imbalance in the system and undermine the principle of "one person, one vote."

In conclusion, the electoral college system is a problematic one for the people. It can result in the winner of the popular vote losing the election, focuses attention on battleground states, and gives more power to smaller states. As the voices of young citizens, we believe it is time for a reevaluation of this system. Our democracy should prioritize the principle of "one person, one vote," ensuring that the choice of the people is truly reflected in the outcome of our elections.
