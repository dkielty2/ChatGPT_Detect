Texting while driving is an extremely dangerous act that diverts attention away from the road. When our eyes, hands, and minds are occupied by our cell phones, our ability to focus on operating a vehicle greatly diminishes.

To tackle this issue, various laws have been enacted to deter drivers from using their phones behind the wheel.
