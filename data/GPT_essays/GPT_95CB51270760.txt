The Electoral College: A Reason for Change

The Electoral College has been at the center of much debate in recent years. Many people argue that it is an outdated system that no longer accurately represents the will of the nation. It is a system that I, as a 6th-12th grader, believe should be changed for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College does not always reflect the popular vote. This means that the candidate who actually receives the most votes nationwide may not be the one who becomes president. This seems unfair and undemocratic. Why should the voice of many be silenced in favor of a system that doesn't truly represent the will of the people?

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives more weight to certain states over others. This means that the votes of people in smaller states are worth more than those in larger states. This seems like a clear violation of the principle of "one person, one vote." Why should someone's vote carry more weight just because they live in a less populous state? Every citizen's vote should hold equal importance.

Not only is the Electoral College an unfair system, but it is also outdated. It was established by the founding fathers when communication and transportation were much different than they are today. Back then, this system made sense because it was difficult to count votes and gather widespread opinions. However, times have changed, and technology now allows for accurate counting and reporting of votes. It is time for our electoral system to change as well, to keep up with the advancements of the modern world.

Additionally, the Electoral College can sometimes lead to unforeseen and unpredictable outcomes, like what happened in the 2016 presidential election. This can be frustrating for voters, as it undermines their belief in the democratic process. Why should a few swing states have the power to determine the outcome of a national election? Every citizen's vote, regardless of their state, should have an equal impact.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is in dire need of change. It is an unfair and outdated system that does not accurately represent the will of the nation. The fact that a candidate can win the presidency without winning the popular vote is unacceptable. Every vote should carry equal weight, and the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide should be declared the winner. It is time for our nation to come together and reform the Electoral College, ensuring that our democracy is truly representative of the people's choice.
