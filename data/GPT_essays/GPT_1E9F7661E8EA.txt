Being a student in middle school can be a whirlwind of activities and experiences. From the average day filled with classes and homework to the extracurriculars that we participate in, there is never a dull moment. However, there is one "B" that many students strive to avoid - the dreaded average grade. It often becomes a topic of discussion among students, and many think that the grading policy should be fairer.

The current grading policy in our school is quite strict. To get an "A," students must strive for perfection and never make any mistakes. As a result, many feel an immense pressure to achieve this level of excellence. On the other hand, a "B" feels like a failure even though it should be considered above average. This mindset can be detrimental to students' mental health as they constantly strive for perfection and constantly feel disappointed if they fall short.

One way we think the policy could be fairer is by considering the effort put into assignments. There are occasions when a student may put in a tremendous amount of effort into a project but may not quite reach the desired outcome. In such cases, it would be fair to reward the effort and dedication put forth by the student. Incorporating effort as a factor in grading would motivate students to take on challenging tasks and give them the recognition they deserve.

Additionally, it would be valuable for teachers to give students the opportunity to improve their grades. Currently, if a student receives a low grade on a test or assignment, they are often discouraged, feeling like there is no chance for improvement. Having the chance to retake a test or redo an assignment would not only give students a second chance to understand and learn the material, but it would also demonstrate that improvement is possible and that mistakes are a part of the learning process.

Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that every student has their strengths and weaknesses. The current grading policy puts a strong emphasis on academic performance, but neglects other aspects of a student's growth. It would be beneficial to adopt a more holistic approach to grading that considers students' progress in various areas, such as classroom participation, collaboration, and critical thinking skills. This way, students who may not excel in traditional academic subjects can still thrive and be recognized for their talents and abilities.

In conclusion, the current grading policy in our school leaves many students feeling overwhelmed and discouraged. By taking into consideration effort, offering opportunities for improvement, and adopting a more holistic approach to grading, we can create a fairer system that recognizes and supports the growth and development of every student. It is time for a change that ensures students' peace of mind and encourages them to reach their full potential.
