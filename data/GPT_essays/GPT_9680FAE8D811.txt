Title: Why We Need to Get Rid of the Electoral College

Introduction:
The Electoral College has long been a topic of debate in the United States. As a young citizen of this country, I think it's important to express my concerns about this system and why we should consider getting rid of it. In this essay, I will explain the reasons why the electoral college needs to go.

Body:

First, let's discuss the concept of the electoral college. The electoral college is a system in which the president of the United States is chosen. Rather than the popular vote deciding the outcome, the electoral college allocates a certain number of votes to each state, based on the state's population. However, this can result in a situation where the candidate who wins the popular vote doesn't become the president, as we saw in the 2016 election.

One of the main reasons we need to get rid of the electoral college is because it devalues individual votes. Many people think that their vote doesn't count because they live in a state that typically leans heavily towards one political party. This discourages participation in the democratic process, and ultimately undermines the principle of "one person, one vote". Each vote should carry equal weight, regardless of where you live.

Moreover, the electoral college can sometimes lead to a candidate winning the presidency without winning the majority of the popular vote. This seems unfair and undemocratic. In a true democracy, the candidate who receives the most votes should be the one chosen by the people as their leader.

Another problem with the electoral college is that it often leads to candidates focusing solely on so-called "battleground states" during campaigns. They often neglect states that are considered "safe" for one party or the other. This means that voters in those states don't get the same attention or consideration as those in battleground states. It's important that every vote matters and every citizen is heard, regardless of where they live.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the electoral college is an outdated system that needs to be reconsidered. We must think about what is fair and just in choosing our president. It is essential to ensure that each individual vote carries equal weight and that the candidate who truly receives the most votes becomes our leader. Our democracy deserves a system that truly represents the will of the people. It's time to get rid of the electoral college and embrace a more just and democratic way of electing our president.
