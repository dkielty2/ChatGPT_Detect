The New School Policy: A Student's Perspective

As a student, I would like to express my thoughts on the new policy that our school has recently implemented. This policy has made some significant changes to the way we student used to work, and I believe it may have both positive and negative consequences.

One of the most notable changes is the new grading system. Instead of traditional letter grades, our school now uses a grading scale based on averages. This means that our final grade will be determined by calculating an average of all the assignments and tests throughout the semester. While this may seem like a fair and accurate way to assess our performance, it can also be quite stressful for students. The pressure to maintain a high average can be overwhelming and may lead to increased anxiety and decreased motivation among students.

Another reason why some students are not in favor of this new policy is that it places a heavy emphasis on average grades. Some students may excel in certain subjects, while struggling in others. With the new policy, a high average grade may not accurately reflect a student's true abilities in different subjects. This can be demoralizing and discourage students from pursuing their passions.

On the other hand, there are some positive aspects to this new policy. It encourages students to work consistently throughout the semester, rather than relying solely on major assessments. By calculating averages, students are motivated to stay on track and complete all assignments to the best of their abilities. This can lead to a better understanding of the material and improved overall academic performance.

Moreover, this policy also prepares students for higher education and the real world. In college and future careers, success is often measured by average performance over time, rather than individual assignments or tests. By introducing this new policy at the school level, students are being equipped with the skills and mindset necessary for future success.

In conclusion, the new policy implemented by our school has both advantages and disadvantages. While it may put pressure on students to maintain a high average grade, it also encourages consistent work and prepares us for future challenges. It is important for the school administration to listen to student feedback and make adjustments if necessary, in order to create an environment that fosters both academic excellence and student well-being.
