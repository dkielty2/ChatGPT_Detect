These skills will prove beneficial in your future endeavors, whether you choose a career at sea, in agriculture, or even as a veterinarian.

One of the best aspects of this program is the people you’ll meet. You’ll be part of a close-knit community of fellow seagoing cowboys who share the same passion for adventure and animals. Friendships will be formed as you work together to ensure the animals are safe and comfortable throughout the voyage. The connections you make could last a lifetime!
