The Electoral College: An Outdated System

In the United States, we have a unique way of electing our president called the Electoral College. As a young student, learning about this system can feel quite puzzling. So, what exactly is the Electoral College? Well, it is a process where each state is given a number of electors based on its population. These electors are the people who ultimately decide which candidate will become the president. However, many people argue that the Electoral College is outdated and doesn't truly represent the will of the people.

One of the main criticisms of the Electoral College is that it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency even if they did not receive the majority of the popular vote. This means that a candidate could become president even if the majority of people in the country voted for someone else. This seems unfair because the whole point of voting is to have our voices heard and to elect the candidate that we feel would best represent us. Yet, the Electoral College doesn't always ensure this outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College puts too much emphasis on the state level rather than the individual's vote. Each state is given a specific number of electors, which means that smaller states can have a disproportionate amount of influence in the election. For example, the state of Wyoming has three electors, while the state of California has 55 electors. This means that each individual vote in Wyoming carries more weight than each individual vote in California. This imbalance is not fair and goes against the principle of "one person, one vote."

Moreover, the Electoral College system is outdated in today's society. When it was first established, communication and transportation were not as advanced as they are now. The framers of the Constitution created the Electoral College as a compromise between electing the president through congressional vote and popular vote. However, in a modern era with reliable communication and transportation, the need for the Electoral College is questionable.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an outdated system that has its flaws. It doesn't always ensure that the candidate who received the majority of the popular vote becomes the president, and it gives too much power to individual states rather than the people. With advancements in technology and society, it's time to reconsider the Electoral College and find a more fair and democratic way to elect our president. After all, the voice of every American citizen should always matter in choosing their leader.
