Title: The Electoral College: An Unfair System That Could Be Improved

Introduction (40 words):
The electoral college is an important aspect of the electoral system in the United States. However, many students like me wonder if this system truly represents the will of the people. In this essay, I will discuss why the electoral college seems unfair and propose ways in which technology could make the voting process more just and accurate.

Body Paragraph 1 (80 words):
One reason why the electoral college is seen as unjust is because it can undermine the principle of "one person, one vote." As we know, every state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes based on their population size. This means that a person's vote in a smaller state has more weight than in a larger state. For example, Wyoming has only three electoral votes, while California has 55. This discrepancy can give citizens of smaller states more influence over the election outcome than those in more populous states.

Body Paragraph 2 (90 words):
Another issue with the electoral college is its winner-takes-all system in most states. This means that even if a candidate wins by a narrow margin, they receive all the state's electoral votes. As a result, the opinions and voices of a significant portion of the population are not considered. This system can lead to situations where a politician wins the electoral college but not the popular vote, which some may feel is unfair and undemocratic.

Body Paragraph 3 (100 words):
Technology, if utilized properly, has the potential to improve the electoral system. Online platforms and apps could provide voters with accurate and easily accessible information about candidates, their policies, and their stance on important issues. This would enable voters to make more informed decisions. Furthermore, electronic voting systems could be implemented to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the voting process. By using technology to streamline the voting process, we could potentially eliminate discrepancies caused by the electoral college and ensure a fairer representation of the people's will.

Conclusion (60 words):
In conclusion, the current electoral college system does not always reflect the majority's choice, making it seem unfair. However, by leveraging technology, we could modernize the voting process and make it more transparent and equitable. Implementing accessible information platforms and electronic voting systems would ultimately empower citizens to participate more actively in the democratic process, ensuring that every vote counts, regardless of state size or population. It is time to embrace technological advancements for a more fair and representative electoral system.
