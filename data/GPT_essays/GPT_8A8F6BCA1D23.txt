The Electoral College: Should It Stay or Should It Go?

The Electoral College is a key component of the United States' presidential election process. However, many people argue that it doesn't accurately represent the voice of the people. As a 6-12 grader, I have considered both sides of the debate and question whether abolishing the Electoral College would take away our right to a fair and democratic election.

The Electoral College is an institution that determines the outcome of the presidential election, in which each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The candidate who secures the majority of these electoral votes becomes the president. This system was created to balance power between small and large states, preventing the dominance of highly populated states over less populated ones.

While the Electoral College has its merits, it has faced criticism for not reflecting the popular vote. This means that a candidate can win the presidency without securing the majority of the nationwide popular vote. In such cases, some argue that the system takes away the right of the people to choose their leader directly.

If the Electoral College were abolished, the popular vote would determine the outcome of the presidential election. This means that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide would win. Proponents argue that this change would make our democracy more representative and fair, as every vote would count equally. It would also eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency despite being supported by fewer voters.

However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of abolishing the Electoral College. Smaller states would undoubtedly lose their influence in the election process, as candidates would primarily focus on highly populated states. The voices and concerns of citizens in less populated areas could be overshadowed by those in major cities. This could further deepen divisions between urban and rural areas, potentially undermining the unity of our nation.

Moreover, abolishing the Electoral College would require a constitutional amendment. To achieve this, a two-thirds majority in Congress and agreement from three-fourths of the states would be necessary. Such a significant change to our election process would not come without challenges and potential resistance from states who benefit from the current system.

In conclusion, the debate over abolishing the Electoral College is complex. While it is true that the system doesn't always reflect the popular vote accurately, it also serves as a mechanism to ensure smaller states have a say in the election process. Ultimately, any proposed reform should be carefully considered, taking into account both the potential benefits and drawbacks. As a young citizen, I believe it is essential for us to weigh the consequences before making any significant changes to an institution that has been agreed upon for centuries.
