The Electoral College: Shaping Our Votes

Every four years, the United States engages in a unique process to elect its next president. This process, known as the electoral college, plays a significant role in determining who will sit in the Oval Office. As a young student, it is important for me to understand the electoral system and how my vote is counted.

The electoral college is a system in which each state is given a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. This means that states with more people, like California or Texas, have more electoral votes than smaller states, such as Wyoming or Vermont. It is these electoral votes that ultimately decide who wins the presidential election.

When I think about the electoral college, I wonder if it is the most fair and democratic way to choose our president. On one hand, it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election. Without the electoral college, candidates might only focus on large states and ignore the concerns of less populated areas. By giving each state a number of electoral votes, the electoral college balances the power between states and gives voice to all citizens.

However, there are also flaws in this system. One of the main criticisms is that it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote, meaning they receive more individual votes nationwide, but still lose the electoral college and the presidency. This happened in the 2016 election when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but Donald Trump won the electoral college and became president.

As a middle school student, I believe changes could be made to the electoral college to make it more fair. One possibility would be to revise the allocation of electoral votes. Currently, most states have a winner-takes-all approach, meaning if a candidate wins the majority of votes in a state, they receive all of its electoral votes. Instead, states could adopt a proportional system, where electoral votes are divided proportionally based on the popular vote. This would ensure that every vote counts and allow for a more accurate representation of the people's choice.

In conclusion, the electoral college is a complex process that impacts our votes and determines our president. While it has its benefits, such as giving smaller states a voice, there are aspects that could be improved to make the system more fair. As a student, I hope that in the coming years, the electoral college will be reevaluated, taking into consideration the will of the people and ensuring that every vote truly matters.
