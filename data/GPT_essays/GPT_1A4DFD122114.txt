The Electoral Vote System: A Flawed Method of Choosing Our President

The United States has a unique system for electing its president known as the Electoral Vote System. This method has been in place for many years, but it is becoming increasingly clear that it is flawed and in need of reform. Many citizens, including myself, believe that the popular vote should be the primary determinant of who becomes our president.

Under the current system, each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. This means that some states have more influence over the outcome of the election than others. For example, a candidate could win the popular vote in a state like California, with its large population, but lose the overall election because they failed to secure enough electoral votes. This system undermines the principle of “one person, one vote” and instead gives more weight to some votes depending on where they are cast.

In addition, the winner-takes-all approach in most states can lead to a distortion of the will of the people. If a candidate wins a state by a small margin, they are awarded all of its electoral votes. This means that the votes of those who supported the losing candidate are essentially disregarded. This winner-takes-all system can result in an inaccurate representation of the preferences of the people.

A popular vote system, on the other hand, would provide a fairer and more democratic method of selecting our president. With this approach, every vote would truly count. The candidate who receives the most votes nationwide would become the president. This method would ensure that each citizen's voice carries equal weight, regardless of where they live. It would eliminate the discrepancy between the electoral and popular vote outcomes, which has raised concerns in several past elections.

Critics argue that a popular vote system would give too much power to densely populated areas, neglecting the concerns of smaller states. However, this argument fails to consider the fact that candidates would still have an incentive to campaign in all states to secure as many votes as possible. It would also encourage candidates to address the needs and issues faced by citizens nationwide, rather than focusing solely on swing states.

In conclusion, the Electoral Vote System is a flawed method of choosing our president. It undermines the principle of equal representation and fails to accurately reflect the will of the people. A popular vote system, where the candidate with the most votes becomes president, would provide a fairer and more democratic approach. It is time for our country to reconsider the current electoral system and ensure that every vote counts.
