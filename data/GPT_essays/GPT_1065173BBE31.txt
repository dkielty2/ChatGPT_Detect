Cars are a common sight in the world today. They have become an essential part of our lives, making transportation faster and more convenient. That's why it's no surprise that the car industry is a capital-intensive industry, with companies investing large sums of money to develop new models for consumers.

However, the increasing number of cars on the road has led to a major problem: smog. Smog is a type of air pollution that is primarily caused by the emissions from vehicles, especially those that use diesel as their fuel source. This issue has gained global attention, with organizations like Reuters reporting on the negative impact of smog on the environment and public health.

The world is now grappling with how to tackle this issue. One approach is to encourage the use of electric cars instead of diesel-powered ones. Electric cars produce zero emissions, making them a cleaner and more sustainable choice. However, the downside is that electric cars still come with a hefty price tag. The high price of electric cars can be a deterrent for many consumers, especially those on a tight budget.

Nevertheless, there are efforts being made to make electric cars more affordable. Governments and car manufacturers are working together to introduce incentives and subsidies to lower the price of electric vehicles. These initiatives aim to make electric cars a viable option for more people, paving the way for a greener future.

In conclusion, cars play a significant role in our daily lives, providing us with a means of transportation that is efficient and convenient. However, the environmental impact of cars, particularly diesel-powered ones, is a pressing issue. Smog has become a global concern, attracting attention from international news outlets like Reuters.

The world is gradually shifting towards electric cars to combat this problem. Although the capital-intensive nature of the car industry makes electric cars more expensive, efforts are being made to bring down their prices. By providing incentives and subsidies, governments and car manufacturers hope to make electric cars more accessible and affordable.

Ultimately, the transition to electric cars is a step in the right direction towards reducing emissions and creating a cleaner environment for future generations. It's important for us, as responsible citizens, to stay informed about the impact of cars on the environment and support initiatives that promote sustainable transportation. Only then can we make a difference and contribute to a world free from smog and pollution.
