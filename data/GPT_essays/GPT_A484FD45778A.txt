Title: The Online Class Game: Affecting What Students Really Want

Introduction:
In this modern era, where technology takes the center stage, online classes have become a new trend for students. This essay will explore how online classes, with their plethora of videos and the temptation to game on our phones, affect what students truly want - an engaging school experience.

The Allure of Online Classes:
Online classes are revolutionizing education by bringing learning to our fingertips. With just a click, we can access a wide range of videos that cater to different subjects, making learning more interactive and exciting. These videos often provide detailed explanations and in-depth examples that enhance our understanding of the material.

The Temptation of Technology:
However, the temptation to get distracted by our phones during online classes is a constant battle. With notifications popping up and games beckoning from our screens, it is challenging to resist the urge to divert our attention. Consequently, this can negatively impact our focus and engagement in class, jeopardizing our understanding of the material being taught.

The Desire for an Engaging Classroom:
Deep down, students also crave a classroom experience that is not solely digital. While online classes offer flexibility and convenience, they lack the interpersonal connections and dynamic discussions that a traditional classroom setting provides. Students want to interact with their peers and teachers in real time, engaging in debates, exchanging ideas, and collaborating on projects.

Effects on Motivation:
The online format can sometimes impact student motivation. Without the energy and atmosphere of a physical classroom, it becomes easier for students to feel unmotivated or disconnected from their studies. The lack of immediate feedback and accountability can also discourage students from actively participating in the learning process.

Finding a Balance:
To ensure online classes meet the needs of students, it is important to strike a balance between the advantages of technology and the benefits of in-person interaction. Teachers can incorporate discussion forums, group projects, and interactive online platforms to foster student engagement. Additionally, setting guidelines on the use of phones during class can help minimize distractions and maximize focus.

Conclusion:
While online classes have undoubtedly brought convenience and accessibility to education, they also come with their own set of challenges. Students must not succumb to the allure of videos and games, but instead, demand a well-rounded learning experience. By acknowledging the importance of interaction, engagement, and active participation, we can create an online class environment that truly caters to what students want and need. Ultimately, it is vital to find a balance between technology and traditional aspects of education, ensuring students can thrive academically while staying connected to their peers and educators.
