After analyzing additional images from different angles and better resolution, scientists discovered that the face-like structure on Mars is simply a result of the play of light and shadow on the Martian surface. The formation is due to a combination of erosion, wind, and geological processes, which have shaped the surface over time. It is a clear example of a pareidolia, where humans tend to perceive familiar patterns, such as faces, in random objects or natural forms.
