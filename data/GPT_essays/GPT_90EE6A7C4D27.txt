How do driverless cars work? (100 words)
Driverless cars operate through a complex system of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence. These sensors constantly gather data from their surroundings, allowing the vehicle to perceive its environment and react accordingly. The car's advanced algorithms process this data to make decisions, such as changing lanes, stopping at traffic lights, and navigating through complex intersections. With the absence of a human driver, these vehicles rely solely on their intelligent systems to safely transport passengers.

Benefits of driverless cars (80 words)
One of the great advantages of driverless cars is the potential improvement in safety. Studies suggest that over 90% of car accidents occur due to human error. By removing the driver as a potential source of error, autonomous vehicles have the potential to drastically reduce accidents on the road. This technology also offers increased accessibility, as driverless cars could provide transportation for people with disabilities or the elderly who may face difficulties driving.

Safety measures (100 words)
To ensure the safety of passengers and pedestrians, driverless cars are equipped with various safety features. These include advanced warning systems that can detect and respond to potential hazards. For instance, if the car senses an obstacle, it can automatically apply brakes or change its route to avoid a collision. In addition, these vehicles constantly communicate with each other, allowing them to share information on traffic conditions, potential hazards, and road obstacles.

Conclusion (50 words)
Driverless cars represent a remarkable advancement in the automotive industry. With their sophisticated systems, like autonomous driving, they have the potential to enhance safety, reduce accidents, and provide efficient and accessible transportation. Although there may be concerns and hurdles to overcome in their implementation, driverless cars hold great promise for the future of transportation.
