Title: The Unfairness in School Activities

Introduction (50 words):
In the bustling corridors of our school, students engage in a variety of activities every day. However, some believe that certain aspects of school life, such as rules and grading systems, can be unfair. This essay aims to shed light on the notion that school activities can sometimes become a source of frustration for students who feel that their hard work is not duly recognized or rewarded.

School Rules and Regulations:
One of the main areas of contention among students is the implementation of certain rules. Many students feel that some rules are unfair and restrict their personal expression or creativity. For instance, the dress code policy might be seen as restrictive by students who wish to express their individuality through fashion. Some argue that instead of focusing on appearances, schools should prioritize qualities like kindness and respect. While rules are essential for maintaining order, it is crucial for administrators to consider student perspectives when creating and enforcing them.

The Unjust Average:
Another common challenge faced by students relates to the grading system, particularly the concept of averages. Students often strive to excel academically and put in tremendous effort to achieve high grades. However, the use of averages can sometimes undermine their hard work. When an "average" is calculated, it fails to acknowledge the exceptional performances of students who consistently excel but may have one or two lower scores. This system can be demotivating and does not accurately reflect a student's true abilities or efforts. Schools should consider alternative methods of assessment that focus on overall growth and individual achievements, rather than solely relying on averages.

Sports and the Student Experience:
Participation in sports represents another aspect of school life that can be perceived as unfair by some students. In many schools, the emphasis on competitiveness and winning can overshadow the joy and camaraderie that sports can provide. It's disheartening when only a select few students receive the opportunity to represent the school in sports competitions, while others, who may be equally passionate, never get a chance to showcase their skills. Schools should aim to include and encourage all students, regardless of their skill level, fostering a sense of inclusivity and teamwork.

Conclusion (20 words):
Although schools are environments designed to foster growth and development, excessive rules, unfair grading systems, and exclusive sports practices undermine that purpose. It is crucial for schools to create fair and supportive environments that empower and inspire all students.
