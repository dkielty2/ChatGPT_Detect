Colleges look for well-rounded individuals who not only excel academically but also contribute to their community and display leadership qualities. Being involved in clubs and activities demonstrates our commitment, dedication, and ability to manage time effectively.

Extracurricular activities in school play a vital role in our personal and overall development. They provide us with opportunities to explore our interests, build important life skills, and foster strong connections with like-minded individuals.
