Title: The Importance of Changing the Electoral Voting System

Introduction:
The electoral voting system is an integral part of electing our nation's president. As people, we hold the power to vote and shape the future of our country. However, there is an increasing debate about whether the current electoral voting system is the most effective and fair method. This essay will explore the need for changing the current electoral voting system to a popular vote system and its potential benefits for a better democracy.

Body:

1. Representation of the People:
The people's voice should be at the heart of the electoral process. By implementing a popular vote system, each individual's vote would carry equal weight. This ensures that every citizen's opinion matters, regardless of the state they reside in. It would allow for a fair and accurate representation of the people's choice for the president.

2. Eliminating the Electoral College:
The electoral college system, which currently determines the outcome of the presidential election, can sometimes lead to discrepancies between the popular vote and the final result. Changing the system to a popular vote would eliminate this disparity, as the candidate with the most votes nationwide would win the presidency. This would better reflect the will of the people and avoid situation where presidents are elected despite not receiving the majority of the popular vote.

3. Promoting a Better Democracy:
In a democracy, it is crucial to ensure that the voting system accurately represents the will of the people. By transitioning to a popular vote system, more citizens would feel encouraged and motivated to participate in the electoral process. This change would enhance the democratic values of our nation, making citizens feel more empowered and heard.

4. Encouraging Voter Engagement:
The current electoral voting system can create situations where voters feel discouraged from participating, especially if they live in states that consistently lean towards one political party. By adopting a popular vote system, every vote would count, regardless of the state's political leaning. This would motivate individuals to engage in the voting process, creating a more informed and active citizenry.

Conclusion:
Changing the electoral voting system to a popular vote system can bring various benefits to our democracy. It would ensure a fair representation of the people, eliminate discrepancies between the popular vote and the final outcome, promote a better democracy, and encourage voter engagement. As young citizens, it is up to us to advocate for a change that better serves the people's interests. By implementing a popular vote system, we can create a stronger and more inclusive electoral process, giving every citizen an equal opportunity to shape the future of our nation.
