Title: The Changing Policy of Averaging Grades: A Student's Perspective

Introduction:
When it comes to student life, activities and sports play a pivotal role in shaping our experiences outside the classroom. However, one particular school policy has caught the attention of students lately â€“ the changing policy of averaging grades. In this essay, we will dive into this topic from a student's perspective, considering the reasons behind this alteration and the implications it has on our academic progress and overall well-being.

Body:

1. The average grade system:
For as long as we can remember, grades have been an integral part of our educational journey. Averaging grades has been a fundamental principle used to evaluate student performance across various subjects. It considers our consistent effort and commitment to learning throughout the grading period. This method allows teachers to assess our overall understanding and growth, making it an essential tool in determining our academic progress.

2. The need for change:
However, the recent change in our school's grading policy has led to mixed feelings among the student body. Some students think that the shift towards averaging grades might not accurately reflect their abilities and hard work. They argue that one poor grade can disproportionately impact their overall average, unfairly undermining the effort they put into other subjects. This concern has prompted both support and opposition in the student community.

3. Students' perception:
Many students believe that changing the grading policy could motivate them to put more effort into their studies. With a system that evaluates each subject individually rather than averaging grades, students may feel a renewed sense of agency and responsibility to excel in every subject. They argue that this approach aligns better with the real-world application of knowledge, where a holistic understanding of individual skills is often more valued than an average representation.

4. The reason behind the change:
The school administration's decision to change the grading policy stems from their belief that this shift will encourage students to strive for excellence in every aspect of their academic pursuits. The goal is to promote a growth mindset and a deep understanding of each subject by providing students with a clear measurement of their competency in individual areas, rather than diluting their efforts with an averaged representation.

Conclusion:
The changing policy of averaging grades has sparked a significant debate among students. While some argue that this shift will better recognize their effort and potential, others express concerns about unfair representation and its potential impact on college applications. As students, it is important for us to embrace changes that encourage growth and learning, while also advocating for fair evaluation across all subjects. This ongoing conversation allows us to shape educational policies that best benefit our academic journey, ensuring we receive a well-rounded education that prepares us for the challenges of the future.
