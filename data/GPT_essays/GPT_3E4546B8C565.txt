The Electoral College: A Disaster for Fair Voting

The Electoral College has been a topic of much debate and controversy in recent years. Many argue that this system is unfair and undermines the principle of one person, one vote. As a 6th-12th grader, I have learned about the flaws of the Electoral College and why it is the worst possible method for electing our leaders.

Firstly, the concept of electors is confusing and undemocratic. We, the people, cast our votes in the presidential election, but ultimately, it is the electors who have the final say. These electors are not chosen by the people, but by the political parties. This means that the people's voice can be overridden by a handful of individuals who may not accurately represent our interests.

Moreover, the Electoral College can lead to unfair outcomes. In this system, the winner takes all the electoral votes of a state, regardless of the margin of victory. This means that even if a candidate wins by a small majority, they receive all the electoral votes from that state. This has resulted in situations where the majority of the people voted for one candidate, but the other candidate won the presidency because they won the Electoral College. This is not fair and does not reflect the will of the people.

The 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore is a prime example. Gore won the popular vote, yet Bush won the Electoral College. This created a sense of injustice and left many feeling that their vote did not matter. The winner-takes-all approach of the Electoral College can lead to grave consequences and undermines the democratic process.

Furthermore, this system encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on battleground states. States that are traditionally Republican or Democratic are often overlooked because candidates know they are likely to win or lose those states regardless. Instead, they focus on states with a more evenly split electorate, like Ohio or Florida. This means that the concerns and interests of people living in non-battleground states are often ignored.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a disaster for fair voting. Its structure allows for an unfair distribution of power and encourages the neglect of certain states and their citizens. The winner-takes-all approach and the fact that electors have the final say diminishes the power of individual voters. The 2000 election between Bush and Gore is a prime example of why this system is flawed and needs to be reformed. The Electoral College is the worst method for electing our leaders, and it is time for a change.
