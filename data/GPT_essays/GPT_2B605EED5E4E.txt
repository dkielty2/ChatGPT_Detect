When we open ourselves up to different perspectives, we gain a more comprehensive view of the problem at hand. This expanded vision allows us to evaluate the situation more objectively, leading to a better understanding of the possible choices available. It enables us to think critically, analyze potential outcomes, and make informed decisions based on a well-rounded standpoint.
