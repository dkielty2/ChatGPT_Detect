Title: The Electoral College: An Unfair System in Keeping Every Vote Counted

Introduction (words: 50)
In the United States, the Electoral College plays a significant role in determining the President. However, many argue that this system can be unfair to voters. This essay will explore the inconsistencies of the Electoral College, emphasizing its impact on individual votes and the need for a more inclusive system.

Body Paragraph 1: The Unequal Distribution of Votes (words: 90)
The Electoral College allocates electoral votes based on each state's population. Consequently, less populated states tend to have more votes per capita than their more populous counterparts. This proves to be problematic, as it diminishes the influence of individual votes in densely populated areas. It is essential to remember that every vote should hold equal weight, regardless of where it is cast.

Body Paragraph 2: Winner-Takes-All Approach (words: 90)
The "winner-takes-all" system further disrupts the fairness of the Electoral College. In most states, the candidate who wins the popular vote gets all of the electoral votes from that state. This leads to situations where even a slight majority can secure all the electoral votes, ignoring the voices of the significant minority. It deprives countless citizens of having their preferences considered in the presidential election.

Body Paragraph 3: Swing States and Neglected Votes (words: 110)
Under the Electoral College, candidates tend to focus their efforts and resources on swing states, where the race is highly competitive. Consequently, states that are traditionally red or blue are often overlooked, resulting in voters feeling disregarded. By placing undue emphasis on a select few states, the Electoral College fails to ensure that every voter's voice is heard, regardless of the state they reside in.

Conclusion (words: 80)
The Electoral College's structure undermines the principle of "one person, one vote." Its unequal distribution of votes, winner-takes-all approach, and focus on swing states all contribute to an unfair system that does not guarantee a true representation of the people's choice. To rectify this, it is crucial to explore alternative methods like a popular vote system, ensuring that every citizen's vote has equal significance in electing the nation's president.
