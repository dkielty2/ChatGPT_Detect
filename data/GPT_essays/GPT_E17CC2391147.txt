Joining a seagoing program can be an exciting and rewarding experience for anyone looking to explore new places and embark on thrilling adventures. As a 6-12 grader, I was initially drawn to the idea of becoming a seagoing cowboy, as it combined my love for animals and the ocean. Little did I know, this decision would lead me to a whole new world of opportunities and experiences.

One of the main reasons why I decided to join the seagoing program was the chance to visit new places. As a seagoing cowboy, I had the privilege of traveling to various ports around the world, from Europe to Asia and everywhere in between. Each place offered a unique cultural experience and allowed me to learn about different customs and traditions.

Being a seagoing cowboy also meant taking risks. Going out to sea can be unpredictable, and one must be prepared for any challenges that may arise. Whether it was rough weather or difficult circumstances, I learned to adapt and overcome obstacles. The sense of adventure and freedom that comes with being on a ship is unparalleled, and it taught me the importance of resilience and perseverance.

Moreover, joining the seagoing program allowed me to take part in important humanitarian work. Seagoing cowboys were responsible for taking care of livestock onboard ships bound for war-torn countries after World War II. It was a challenging and rewarding job, as we had to ensure the well-being of the animals while sailing across treacherous waters. This experience not only taught me empathy but also made me realize the impact that individuals can have when working together towards a common goal.

Aside from the serious aspects, being a seagoing cowboy was also a lot of fun. Living on a ship meant being surrounded by a close-knit community of fellow cowboys. We formed lasting friendships and shared many unforgettable memories. From cowboys' rodeo competitions to impromptu dance parties on deck, there was never a dull moment. It was incredible to see how a group of strangers could come together and create such a vibrant and supportive community.

In conclusion, joining the seagoing program was one of the best decisions I ever made as a 6-12 grader. It allowed me to explore new places, take risks, and engage in important humanitarian work. Moreover, it provided me with lifelong friendships and incredible memories. Looking back, I am grateful for the opportunity to be a seagoing cowboy and I encourage others to take a chance and embark on their own seagoing adventures. Who knows what amazing things they may discover along the way!
