Change is a word that often makes people uncomfortable. It implies something different, something unknown. But as students, change is an integral part of our lives, and it is through change that we grow and develop.

One area in which change can have a significant impact is school policies. As students, we often think about how certain policies could be improved to better meet our needs and help us succeed academically. For example, many of us would like to see a change in the school's dress code policy. While it is important to maintain a respectful and professional learning environment, some feel that the current policy is too strict and restricts our freedom of expression. Allowing students to have a say in the dress code policy could create a more inclusive and comfortable school atmosphere.

Another change that students would like to see is more emphasis on sports and physical activities. At an age when we are bursting with energy, it is essential to have an outlet to channel that energy positively. Engaging in sports can not only help us stay fit but also teach us valuable life skills like teamwork, discipline, and time management. Implementing a more comprehensive sports program would provide opportunities for every student to participate and find their passion.

When it comes to academics, many students think about the average workload we are expected to manage. At times, it can feel overwhelming, with multiple assignments, tests, and projects all due around the same time. One change that students would like to see is a more balanced distribution of workload. By spreading out assignments and tests throughout the term, students would have a better chance to manage their time and avoid burnout.

Lastly, it would be beneficial if schools could offer more variety in extracurricular activities. While some schools have a plethora of options, others have only a few to none. Having a wide range of extracurricular activities would allow students to explore their interests and talents outside the classroom. Activities such as debate clubs, art classes, music ensembles, and community service groups can contribute to a holistic educational experience.

In conclusion, change is a constant in our lives as students, and there are many areas where we think improvements can be made. Whether it is school policies, sports programs, workload management, or extracurricular activities, students would like to see modifications that foster a more inclusive, balanced, and fulfilling educational environment. By listening to student voices and implementing changes that benefit us all, schools can ensure that we are provided with the best possible education and opportunities for growth.
