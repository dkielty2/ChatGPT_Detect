A seagoing trip is undoubtedly no easy task. It requires hard work, dedication, and a deep love for animals. Alongside their usual cowboy gear, these cowboys have to learn about ship safety and follow strict protocols. They must also remain adaptable to the ever-changing weather conditions and be prepared for any challenges that may arise during the journey.

The animals that seagoing cowboys look after are a varied bunch. They not only care for cows but also horses, pigs, and even mules! Imagine the thrill of being surrounded by these majestic creatures while sailing across the ocean. It must be an unparalleled experience for any animal lover.
