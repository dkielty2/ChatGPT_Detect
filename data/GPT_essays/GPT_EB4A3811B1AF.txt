The Electoral Vote: Is it Fair?

The electoral vote is a crucial part of the electoral system in our country. However, many people argue that it is unfair and should be replaced with a popular vote system. As a student in 6th grade, I want to explore this topic and understand how the electoral vote could be improved to make it fair for every voter.

The electoral vote is a system in which each state is assigned a certain number of electors based on its population. These electors then vote for the President on behalf of the people in their state. The candidate who secures a majority of the electoral votes becomes the President. However, this system has its drawbacks.

One unfair aspect of the electoral vote is the "winner-takes-all" rule used by most states. This means that if a candidate wins the majority of the votes in a state, they get all of the state's electoral votes. This can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the election because they did not secure enough electoral votes. This happened in the 2016 Presidential election, and many people felt that their vote did not count.

In my opinion, a popular vote system would be fairer. Under this system, the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide would become the President. This would give every voter an equal say in the election, regardless of which state they live in. It would prevent situations where a candidate could win the election while losing the popular vote.

However, some argue that the electoral vote system gives smaller states a voice in the election. They believe that without the electoral vote, candidates would only focus on heavily populated areas and neglect the concerns of less populated states. While this is a valid concern, there could be a compromise. One possible solution is to reform the electoral vote system by allocating electors proportionally based on the popular vote in each state. This would ensure that every vote counts, while still giving smaller states a fair representation.

In conclusion, the electoral vote system has its flaws and can be considered unfair. While a popular vote system may seem like a more democratic solution, it is essential to consider the concerns of smaller states. A compromise that involves proportional allocation of electors based on the popular vote could be a step towards making the system fairer. Ultimately, every voter wants their vote to count, and it is essential to ensure that our electoral system reflects the will of all citizens.
