Title: The Electoral College: An Indefensible Factor in the Presidential Election

Introduction:

The electoral college is a controversial method of selecting the president in the United States. It is important to understand how it operates, as it can sometimes challenge the will of the people and the popular vote. In this essay, we will explore the electoral college, its impact on the election process, and why it is considered by many as indefensible.

Body:

The electoral college is made up of representatives from each state, known as electors, who cast their votes for the president. The number of electors each state has is determined by their representation in the House of Representatives and the Senate combined. This system was established to balance the power between large and small states, but in our modern society, it seems outdated.

One of the main issues with the electoral college is that it allows for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This happened in the 2016 election, where the candidate who received the most votes from the people ultimately lost the election. This raises questions about the democratic nature of our electoral system and whether it truly represents the will of the people.

Another problem with the electoral college is its distortion of the importance of certain states. Swing states, such as Florida or Ohio, often receive more attention and campaign visits from candidates compared to non-swing states. This gives the citizens of these states more influence over the election outcome, while those in non-swing states may feel their votes are less valuable.

Many argue that the electoral college goes against the principle of "one person, one vote." Since the electors are not obliged to vote according to the popular vote in their state, it opens the possibility of their personal preferences influencing the election outcome. This can lead to a situation where the will of the people is overridden, making the electoral college an indefensible factor in the presidential election.

Conclusion:

The electoral college has long been a topic of debate and criticism in the United States. While it was created to balance the interests of large and small states, in practice, it has often led to outcomes that contradict the popular vote. The influence of swing states and the potential for electors to vote against the will of the people make the electoral college an antiquated and indefensible factor in our presidential election system. It's time to reassess this system and consider alternative methods that truly represent the voices of the people.
