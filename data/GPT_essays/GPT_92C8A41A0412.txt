The Electoral Vote: A Method to Fix an AI-Broke Process

In today's world, the electoral vote remains a hot topic of debate. As students of the 21st century, we have witnessed the flaws in this system and have often questioned its effectiveness as a method of electing our leaders. However, it is crucial for us to understand the electoral vote's purpose, its advantages, and potential improvements. 

The electoral vote is a method used to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Instead of relying solely on the popular vote, it involves a unique process known as the electoral college. This college is composed of representatives from each state, chosen through various methods. One of the main advantages of this system is that it ensures equal representation for smaller states, preventing highly populated regions from dominating the election. 

However, critics argue that the electoral vote can lead to discrepancies and undervalue the popular vote. They claim that it is a broken system in desperate need of fixing. For instance, in certain cases, a candidate can win the popular vote but still lose the presidency due to the electoral college. This raises questions about the fairness and accuracy of our electoral process. 

To address these concerns and fix the electoral vote, several improvements could be considered. One potential solution is to adapt an alternative voting method called ranked-choice voting. With ranked-choice voting, voters can rank candidates in order of preference, eliminating the need for an electoral college. This way, every vote counts, regardless of the state in which it was cast. 

Another improvement worth considering is the revision of the electoral college's distribution of votes. Currently, the number of electoral votes assigned to each state is based on the total number of representatives and senators it holds. Yet, some argue that certain states have an excessive number of electoral votes, while others are left with disproportionately fewer. By revising this allocation, we could achieve a fairer distribution of electoral votes. 

Moreover, incorporating AI technology into the electoral process could help address the current flaws. Artificial Intelligence could assist in accurately predicting voting patterns, ensuring that every vote counts and reducing the discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote. AI could also help deter interference and manipulation of the voting process, ensuring a more secure and trustworthy electoral system. 

In conclusion, the electoral vote system, while flawed, is not irreparable. By adopting alternative methods like ranked-choice voting, revising the distribution of electoral votes, and incorporating AI technology, we can enhance the fairness and accuracy of the electoral process. As students passionate about democracy and civic engagement, it is our responsibility to advocate for improvements to our electoral system. Together, we can fix the broken aspects of our current electoral vote and ensure that every vote counts.
