The Electoral College: A Flawed System in American Voting

The Electoral College is a unique and complex system that determines the President of the United States. Although it is a fundamental part of the American voting system, many argue that it is flawed and in need of reform. As a sixth to twelfth grader, let me explain why.

Firstly, what is the Electoral College? It is a group of representatives from each state who cast their votes based on the popular vote of the people in their state. Each state has a certain number of electoral votes based on its population size, and the candidate who wins the majority of these electoral votes becomes the President. However, the winner-takes-all feature in most states means that even if a candidate wins by a small margin, they get all the electoral votes, leaving behind the voices of those who voted for the opposing candidate.

This brings us to the main critique of the Electoral College: it undermines the principle of "one person, one vote." The system does not guarantee that the candidate who wins the most popular votes nationwide will become President. This can lead to situations where a candidate loses the popular vote but still wins the presidency, as we saw in the 2016 election. It is unfair to the millions of people who cast their votes and expect their voices to be heard.

Moreover, the Electoral College places an emphasis on states rather than individual voters. This means that some states carry more weight in the election than others due to their population size. As a result, candidates focus their campaigning efforts on swing states, neglecting smaller states and potentially alienating certain groups of people. This causes an unequal distribution of attention and resources, ultimately affecting the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the direct implication of the Electoral College is the possibility of electing a President who does not have the popular support of the people. This can erode trust in the democratic process and leave citizens feeling disillusioned and voiceless. It is crucial that the President, as the highest representative of the American people, truly reflects their choice and enjoys their support.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a flawed system in American voting. It undermines the principle of "one person, one vote," places an emphasis on states rather than individual voters, and can lead to the election of a President without the majority popular support. It is time for our elected officials to consider reforms to the Electoral College to ensure that the voices of the American people are accurately reflected in the election of our President.
