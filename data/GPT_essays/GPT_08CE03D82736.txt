Being a student in today's world can be filled with a multitude of activities and responsibilities. From schoolwork to extracurricular activities, there never seems to be enough time in the day. However, engaging in these activities can provide numerous benefits and help us grow as individuals.

One of the most important aspects of being a student is balancing school and extracurricular activities. While school takes up a significant amount of our time, participating in extracurricular activities can greatly enhance our college applications and future prospects. Whether it's joining a sports team, participating in a debate club, or volunteering in the community, these activities showcase our diverse skill sets and passions.

Moreover, engaging in extracurricular activities allows us to meet new friends. Building strong relationships is an essential part of our school experience. Having friends who share common interests and goals can provide a support system that helps us navigate through the challenges of adolescence.

Friends not only provide emotional support but also help us academically. Studying with friends can make the process more enjoyable, as we can discuss and learn from each other. Whenever I have trouble with a subject, I know that I can turn to my friends for help. They explain concepts in a way that is easier for me to understand, reducing my stress levels.

Speaking of stress, finding a balance between school and activities can be challenging. There are times when it feels like the demands of both worlds are too overwhelming. However, participating in activities we are passionate about can actually be an effective stress reliever. Engaging in something we enjoy helps take our minds off school-related stressors and allows us to unwind.

If I could change one thing about school, it would be to incorporate more hands-on activities. I believe that learning by doing is the most effective way to retain information. Instead of solely relying on textbooks and lectures, practical experiences would create a more engaging and interactive learning environment.

In conclusion, being a student involves managing time efficiently and engaging in various activities. Participating in extracurricular activities not only enhances our college applications but also provides opportunities to make new friends and combat stress. While school can be challenging, finding something we are passionate about can make the journey more enjoyable. If given the chance, incorporating more hands-on activities in school would further enhance our learning experiences.
