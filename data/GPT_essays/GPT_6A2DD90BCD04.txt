Activities, school, sport — these words resonate with me as a 6-12 grader. Amid all the fun and play, there's a fine balance between work and play, and it's our kid duty to excel in both. School is a place where we learn, but it's also a place where we can explore various activities, maybe even find our passion.

One of the most popular activities in school is sport. From soccer to basketball, cricket to badminton, there's something for everyone. Sports teach us important life skills and keep us physically fit. It’s hard work, but the sweat and effort pay off on the playground. You need to be dedicated and give it your best shot, because average efforts won't cut it. Each one of us wants to be good at sports, and that requires practice and perseverance.

But it's important to strike a balance between our school work and activities. Average is a word we don't want to associate with our grades. We strive for excellence in our academics, putting in hours of hard work to achieve the best. Sometimes it can get tough, juggling assignments, projects, and exams. But we know that with dedication and effort, we can succeed. Good grades open doors of opportunity, and we want to keep those options open.

As kids, we have a vital role in shaping our own future. School provides us with the tools and knowledge, but it's up to us to make the most of it. We need to take responsibility for our own learning and make the most of the opportunities presented to us. School may seem like a lot of work, but it's also a place to make friends, discover new interests, and learn valuable life lessons.

Play is an essential part of being a kid. It’s the time when we can let loose, have fun, and be ourselves. Whether it's playing with friends at recess or participating in after-school activities, play helps us develop social skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. It's a medium where we can express ourselves freely, without the fear of being judged. Play is an integral part of our overall development as individuals.

So, as a 6-12 grader, our days are filled with a mix of hard work and play. We strive to excel in school, aiming for good grades and a promising future. Meanwhile, we engage in various activities, including sports, that keep us physically fit, teach us important life skills, and offer moments of joy. It's a delicate balance, but with determination and a positive attitude, we can make the most of our school years and become the best version of ourselves.
