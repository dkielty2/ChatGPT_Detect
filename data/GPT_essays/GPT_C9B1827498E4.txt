Being a student is not just about going to school and attending classes. It's also about participating in various activities and clubs that make our school experience more exciting and memorable. One of the activities that every student must participate in is making friends.

Friendships are an essential part of school life. They provide us with companionship, support, and a sense of belonging. Making friends can be as easy as striking up a conversation with someone in class or joining a club that interests you. Having friends at school allows us to share experiences, study together, and have someone to lean on during challenging times.

Speaking of clubs, being a member of at least one club is highly encouraged. Clubs provide opportunities to explore our interests and passions outside of academics. If you're into sports, joining a sports club can provide you with a platform to develop your skills and compete against other schools. Alternatively, if you're more inclined towards literature or art, there are clubs dedicated to those fields as well. No matter what your interests are, there is bound to be a club that caters to them.

In this day and age, the activities we engage in often involve our phones. Whether it's using educational apps to improve our learning or connecting with friends through social media, our phones have become an integral part of our school lives. However, it is important to strike a balance and use our phones responsibly. Excessive phone usage during class or activities can hinder our productivity and distract us from the opportunities around us.

One activity that every student must participate in is volunteering. Volunteering not only gives us a sense of purpose and fulfillment, but it also allows us to contribute to our community and make a positive impact. Whether it's helping out at a local shelter, organizing a fundraiser, or tutoring younger students, volunteering teaches us valuable life skills and helps us become more compassionate individuals.

In conclusion, being a student is not just about academics; it's about actively participating in activities, clubs, and making friends. Joining clubs allows us to explore our interests, develop new skills, and meet like-minded individuals. Making friends plays a crucial role in our school experience, providing us with support and companionship. Our phones can be a valuable tool but must be used responsibly. Lastly, volunteering allows us to give back to our community and learn important life lessons. So, make the most out of your school experience by participating in these activities and creating lasting memories.
