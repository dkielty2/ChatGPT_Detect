The Electoral Collage: A Flawed System 

The electoral vote is an essential part of our American electoral system. However, many people have begun to question its effectiveness and fairness. As a sixth to twelfth-grader, I believe it is crucial to understand the flaws of the electoral collage and advocate for a more popular voting system.

Firstly, the electoral collage often undermines the principle of "one person, one vote." In this system, the state's electoral votes are not distributed equally according to the population. For example, a small state may have more voting power than a larger state. This inequality erodes the principle of fairness that is the foundation of a democratic nation.

Moreover, the popular vote does not always align with the electoral vote. In recent elections, we have witnessed instances where a candidate won the popular vote but lost the election due to the electoral collage. This can lead to frustration and a feeling of disenfranchisement among the people. After all, shouldn't the candidate favored by the majority of citizens be the one elected?

The purpose of an election is to represent the will of the people. However, the electoral collage often fails in accomplishing this goal. Instead of electing the candidate whom the people want, it can potentially lead to the election of a candidate who is not popularly supported. This misalignment between the people's choice and the electoral outcome is a glaring flaw in the system.

Furthermore, the electoral collage can create a divide between the state and national elections. Since electoral votes are allocated based on state lines, it can lead to a focus on winning individual states rather than the overall popular vote. This divisiveness can cause candidates to disproportionately prioritize certain states, neglecting the concerns and needs of others.

Given these issues, it is evident that the electoral collage is in dire need of reform. One potential solution is to transition to a popular voting system, where the candidate who wins the majority of votes nationwide becomes the president. This would better reflect the will of the people and ensure that everyone's vote holds equal weight.

In conclusion, the electoral collage, although an integral part of our electoral system, possesses significant flaws. It undermines the principle of "one person, one vote," can lead to a misalignment between the popular vote and the electoral vote, and can create divisions between state and national elections. As students, we should strive for a more fair and representative system that truly reflects the choice of the people. Let us advocate for reform and work towards a more popular voting system.
