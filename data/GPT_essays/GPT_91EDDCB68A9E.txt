Title: The Electoral College: Why It Shouldn't Make Me Lose My Vote

Introduction:
The election of the President of the United States is a crucial and exciting event that takes place every four years. However, there's something that has been bothering me lately: the Electoral College. It is a system that diminishes the voice of the citizens and should be changed to ensure fair representation for all Americans.

Body:

1. The Electoral College is outdated and doesn't represent the will of the people.
The founding fathers established the Electoral College when communication and transportation were limited. It aimed to balance the interests of large and small states. However, times have changed, and technology has connected us more than ever before. It is time for our voting system to catch up.

2. Every vote should count equally.
The current state-by-state winner-takes-all system used by the Electoral College can lead to a situation where a candidate loses the popular vote but still becomes president. This undermines the principle of democracy, as it allows for the possibility of the candidate who received fewer votes to win the election. Every citizen's vote should have equal weight and influence the outcome of the election directly.

3. Collage the popular vote to eliminate inequality.
One solution could be to abolish the Electoral College and instead rely solely on the popular vote. By doing so, we would ensure that all votes, regardless of the state they come from, are counted fairly. This change would help eliminate the issue of candidates focusing on certain battleground states to secure electoral votes, disregarding others. Every citizen's voice should be heard, regardless of where they live.

4. The role of the citizen in a democratic election.
As citizens, we have the right and responsibility to choose our leaders. However, the Electoral College interferes with this fundamental right. It can leave citizens feeling voiceless and disempowered, especially if they live in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win. By adopting a popular vote system, we would strengthen the connection between the citizen and the election process, ensuring that everyone's voice is heard.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Electoral College is an outdated system that fails to represent the will of the people. It should be changed to ensure that every citizen's vote counts equally. Adopting a popular vote system would eliminate inequality, empower citizens, and uphold the principles of democracy. It is time to make this change and put the power of the presidency back into the hands of the people. Our democracy deserves it.
