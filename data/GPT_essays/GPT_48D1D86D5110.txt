The Electoral Vote: An Outdated and Unfair Process

The electoral vote is a system used in the United States to determine the winner of presidential elections. However, many argue that this process is outdated and unfair. As a 6-12 grader, I believe that it is time for a change.

Firstly, the electoral vote does not accurately represent the will of the people. Instead of relying solely on the popular vote, the system allocates electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress. This means that some states have more electoral votes per capita than others, which is inherently unfair. A candidate can win the presidency without receiving the most individual votes, as we have seen in previous elections. This undermines the democratic principle of "one person, one vote."

Furthermore, the electoral vote favors larger states, often leaving smaller states neglected in the election process. Candidates focus their campaign efforts on swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania, where they can win the most electoral votes. This neglects the needs and concerns of citizens living in other states. For example, a candidate might ignore issues important to the farming community in Iowa because it is not a swing state. This creates an imbalance in representation and an unfair allocation of resources.

In addition, the electoral vote has been in place since the Constitution was written over 200 years ago. Our country has evolved significantly since then, and it is time for our electoral system to catch up. Technology and communication have made it easier for people to stay informed and engaged in the political process. We should reevaluate the way we elect our leaders to ensure that every vote counts.

One possible solution is to abolish the electoral vote entirely and adopt a popular vote system. Every vote should be counted equally, regardless of the state they reside in. This would ensure that the will of the people is accurately reflected in the outcome of the election. Each candidate would have to campaign nationwide, addressing the concerns of voters from various regions and states.

In conclusion, the electoral vote is an outdated and unfair process that no longer serves the needs of our changing society. It does not represent the will of the people, disregards smaller states, and leaves certain voters feeling neglected. It is time for our nation to reevaluate and revamp the electoral process to ensure fairness and equal representation for every voter, regardless of their state or size. Let us move towards a system that embraces the true meaning of democracy - where every vote counts, even mine as a 6-12 grader.
