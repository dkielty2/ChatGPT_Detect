The Electoral College: Why it's Unfair to the Popular Vote

The electoral system in the United States is a fascinating and somewhat confusing one. It revolves around a concept called the Electoral College, which determines the outcome of the presidential election. However, many argue that this system is unfair to the popular vote. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why the electoral system is deemed unfair and how it affects our democratic process.

To understand the issue, it's crucial to comprehend how the Electoral College works. Each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population size. These votes are then awarded to the candidate who receives the majority of votes within that state. The candidate who accumulates at least 270 electoral votes is declared the winner of the presidential election, regardless of whether they won the national popular vote or not.

The main problem with this system is that it doesn't always align with the will of the people. Since the presidency is decided by the Electoral College rather than the popular vote, there have been instances where a candidate wins the presidency despite receiving fewer total votes than their opponent. This discrepancy undermines the principle of "one person, one vote," which is a fundamental component of a fair democratic system.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives smaller states a disproportionate amount of influence in the election. Since each state is awarded electoral votes based on its population, less populated states are overrepresented. This means that a vote in a smaller state carries more weight than a vote in a larger state. This imbalance creates a situation where the voices of some citizens have more power than others, which can be seen as unfair.

Furthermore, the winner-takes-all system practiced by most states in the Electoral College also contributes to the inequity of the system. In these states, the candidate who wins the popular vote within the state receives all of the state's electoral votes. This disregards the votes of citizens who support the losing candidate. This winner-takes-all approach discourages voters who support minority candidates in heavily leaning states since their voices effectively get silenced.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system is widely criticized for its unfairness to the popular vote and its potential to undermine the democratic process. The disproportional representation of smaller states, the winner-takes-all system, and the possibility of a candidate winning without the majority of the popular vote are all aspects that make the system flawed. As future voters, it's important for us to understand the flaws in the electoral system so that we can advocate for a more fair and democratic process in future elections.
