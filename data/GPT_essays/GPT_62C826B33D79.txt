The Electoral College: Keeping the Power in Our Vote

As students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, we are beginning to develop an understanding of how our government works. One of the most important aspects of our government is the electoral college, which plays a major role in electing our President. The question arises - should we keep the electoral college or do away with it completely?

Some argue that the electoral college takes away the power of our vote, as it prevents the popular vote from directly electing the President. However, we believe that the electoral college actually serves an important purpose in our elections.

The electoral college ensures that the President is elected by taking into account the diversity of our nation. It gives smaller states a voice in the election by providing a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of population size. This prevents larger and more populous states from dominating the decision, ensuring that all states have a fair say in choosing our President.

Another reason to keep the electoral college is that it promotes a two-party system. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must secure a majority of electoral votes. This means that candidates need to build support across a wide range of states, appealing to a diverse population. Without the electoral college, it would be easier for smaller third-party candidates to gain traction, potentially leading to fragmented and unstable governments.

Furthermore, the electoral college encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states. They must address the concerns and needs of different communities, rather than solely focusing on the most populated areas. This ensures that the President represents a broader range of people, not just those living in major cities.

While it is true that the electoral college can sometimes result in a divergence between the popular vote and the election outcome, this does not diminish the importance of the electoral college. The purpose of this system is to ensure the election of a President who is supported by a broad range of states and communities, not just the majority.

In conclusion, as young students discovering the workings of our government, we believe that the electoral college should be kept intact. This system guarantees that all states, regardless of size or population, have a voice in electing our President. It encourages candidates to campaign across the nation, representing diverse interests and perspectives. While some argue that the electoral college takes away the power of our vote, we believe that it preserves the democratic principles on which our nation was built.
