The Electoral College: A System that Could Use Change

The electoral system in our country plays a significant role in electing our president. However, many people have started questioning whether this system is the most democratic way to choose our leader. The Electoral College, consisting of electors from each state, determines who becomes the president. Although voting is crucial in this process, there are aspects of the electoral system that could use improvement.

One of the main criticisms of the Electoral College is that it sometimes disregards the popular vote. This means that even if a majority of people in a state vote for one candidate, the electors from that state are not required to follow suit. This can lead to situations where the candidate with the most overall votes does not become the president, as we saw in the 2000 and 2016 elections. This lack of alignment between the popular vote and the electoral vote raises concerns about the fairness of the system.

Moreover, the current system can make people feel like their votes do not count. In some states, the outcome of the election is predetermined due to their historical voting patterns. As a result, voters in those states may feel discouraged from participating, as their vote may not have a significant impact on the electoral outcome. This can lead to voter apathy and a decrease in overall voter turnout.

Additionally, the Electoral College can create a situation where candidates only focus on swing states during their campaigns. Swing states are states that do not consistently vote for a particular political party. Candidates believe that by targeting these states, they can secure enough electoral votes to win the presidency. This method of campaigning leaves out the concerns and needs of citizens in other states, making them feel neglected and unimportant in the electoral process.

It is evident that the current electoral system could use some reevaluation and potential changes to make it more democratic. One possible solution could be to reform the system to reflect the popular vote more accurately. Instead of electors having the final say, the president could be determined solely by the majority of the popular vote. This would ensure that every vote counts and that the candidate supported by the majority becomes the president.

Another change that could be made is to encourage a more balanced allocation of campaign resources. By reducing the focus on swing states and considering the concerns of citizens from all across the nation, campaigns could become more inclusive and representative of the entire population.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a system that requires critical examination and potential change. The disconnect between the popular vote and the electoral vote, the potential disregard for individual votes, and the neglect of citizen concerns in non-swing states are all reasons why improvements should be considered. Through reevaluating the system, we can work towards creating a more democratic and fair way to elect our president. It is essential to remember that every vote matters, and our electoral system should reflect that principle.
